Seven users learnt the headmaster there is now under fire for using a racist slur at a school assembly. Words are a matter of principle for this Brighton College educator. We're looking for not just what has been communicated but how has been communicated. But his words have landed him in hot water using a racist slur not once, but three times at school assembly. Richard Minak used the N word in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack to highlight insidious racism. So mission bread is only a tiny step in language or way from 1400 students were there including the boy who egged Senator Fraser many gasped in shock. You can't say that in front of a school especially a school as multicultural as ours. Mr Minak later emailed students to apologise and explain. I hope you understand that I used it to call out and criticize racism and bigotry. Sometimes we have to use offensive words to explain why they are offensive but now the slur is being used in the playground. I think their theory behind it is if the principal can say why can't we? Late today the education department told seven news. Principal Minak should not have used what they call the offensive word. A spokesperson says he will now be reminded by the department to use appropriate language, Mike.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_576.mp3:  Trump's top officials to attend Christians-Ionist Conference. Memo, a number of senior officials in the Trump administration will be in attendance at a major gathering this week of powerful lobby group Christians united for Israel, Kufai, reported Horits. According to the paper, the conference will feature speeches by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as by Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton. A special envoy to the Middle East, Jason Greenblit, and his ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. The annual summit, held in Washington, DC, will take place today and tomorrow, attracting thousands of evangelical Christians from across the US. Other speakers at the event include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Although Kufai describes itself as bipartisan organization, no Democratic Senators are scheduled to speak. According to Horits, the decision to send senior administration officials to the Kufai gathering is no coincidence, since evangelicals are a key voting block for Trump and the Republicans. Around 80% of White-Evangelicles voted for Trump in 2016, helping them secure victories in several swing states, the paper stated. The consensus among US political analysts is that the president will need similar or greater support among evangelicals to win a second term next year. When the Trump administration relocated the US embassy to Jerusalem, Kufai founder Texas Pastor John Higgy gave a speech at the opening ceremony, declaring, There has never been a more pro-Israeli president than Donald Trump. The paper added that for Trump, the support of the overwhelming majority of White-Evangelicles, those who voted for him in 2016 and who love his Israel policies is crucial. According to recent reports, the president's reelection campaign will seek to mobilize even more evangelical voters. This article originally appeared on Middle East Monitor.\n",

I started watching the series, they have it on Netflix for the people who have Netflix, if you haven't seen it yet, really should check it out. It is a good series. And if it is, anything like the said predictive programming of what we could expect or anything like that, you know, of course it's just like in 1984 scenario. But on episode 6, season 1, you go to the 30 minute mark and they just said something that was really incredible. And it's weird they show these drones flying around and they always imply, you know, they use the word, like if you watch this colony video or the guy talks about it. They talk about the hosts and they imply that they were alien, you know, extraterrestrial invasion. But of course it's kind of, you never see them and you never, you know, it's weird. It's definitely could be, you know, just an elite takeover. But anyway, the 30 minute mark, he says, before they invaded, they knew everything about us. They had data mined everyone. They knew who to hire to be their red hats, you know, instead of the United Nations blue hats, because they knew everybody inside and out. And that's what, you know, you got Facebook or it's probably just the beginning of it. And then you've got these other videos, they talk about the artificial intelligence. What was it out down here? But, you know, there's just a lot of data mining going on. They know everybody, they know everything about everyone. But anyway, I saw it's like 30 minutes into this season 1, episode 6. And he starts explaining how they knew who to pick for what position and, you know, basically they didn't, yeah. And it's just, I thought I'd make a video. So if you have Netflix, you may want to check it out. It's pretty incredible. It's been a good series so far too. Anyway, just want to make a real quick video and share that.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_364.mp3:  Ons Worm Hat in my last video on fake animals. I didn't really talk about the subject of evolution but of course one of the biggest things about these fake animals is they use it to push evolution. If they want you to think that you're just an evolved monkey they got to come up with these smart monkeys in the middle the ones that aren't just so a real monkey are probably just a little tiny spider monkey things that go through the trees super fast and they come down and they steal steal people's foods the ones that are like abundant and people see them all the time they're like pests in a lot of parts of Asia that monkey totally real but they need you to think that you are some sort of evolved form of that and that's why they came out with most of these great apes the great apes are a huge hoax and they're there to push evolution and it's just Hollywood look at the old stuff so this video's on chimpanzees go try to find the oldest photos of chimpanzees that you can find they're the only ones that exist or out of Hollywood and it's because it is straight out of Hollywood it is the same thing as the panda how pandas you can't find old Chinese stuff with pandas painted in them because it's a modern hoax the chimpanzee is a very modern hoax didn't exist in the 1800s the hoax of chimpanzees but they just it appears out of nowhere but at the same time they pretend that it's just always been there if there's monkeys out there that are super advanced using tools they look like a human it would be a known thing but they'll tell you that so just for for instance on the chimpanzees Jane Goodall super modern is like one of the biggest people on chimpanzees of all time if chimpanzees were a real thing people would have been studying them for a really really long time but it's all so recent because it's a recent hoax and if you look at the old stuff it's not good they want you to think that they're really dangerous but then why are they always next to children it's because they won't well cognitive dissonance they they can have you believe whatever they want you to you can have conflicting beliefs all over the place because it's just they tell you so so you believe it they make you think that because this person is an actor they have some sort of magical power over wild animals it's not a good one the old ones are bad it's part of the space hoax the gloves just the hands you can tell are not from a real animal sure I mean it's a it's a convincing hoax but that's what they do if they're hoaxeders this was really bizarre this was really bizarre and I think that this is just in the night I think that what this is is just a really really old fake chimp and it doesn't even look like chimps today but this is some sort of like tabloid type thing inside the bizarre the sun inside the bizarre world of human chimp hybrids I think that this is just an old image of what they would claim as a chimpanzee but nowadays it just looks different and they're trying to say oh this was some human chimp hybrid there's no such thing as chimps they're all hoaxes human chimp hybrid but it's just an old chimp that doesn't look like today's doing a 666 over there I can see some duping the light there okay there's not many old images of these things you can go yourself and they don't look the same like this doesn't quite look like a chim but it's because it's an old one I think the gloves look really really chunky on this old one I don't think the gloves look like this anymore these look like bad bad ones look at that it's why there's not many images old images of these they're probably just because they're bad what you you're gonna have this wild animal that is known known for ripping apart faces you're gonna put it next to a bunch of little little children no it's some midget in a fur suit there's no risk they're always having them dress up like a human it's a big meme PG tips I guess it was a big thing for this T company to use them can't do this to wild animals okay cannot have wild animals do this jingudal's a tranny and there's no way that the leading expert in something would be in the 60s for something like this that would be so extraordinary so extraordinary for there to be animals out there that are using tools and very human-like it would be a well-known well documented well studied things why weren't they studied when Africa was colonized it's because it's a BS species they just pulled it out in air in the 1900s we need we need these links for evolution so they make up the animal you're the duping delight over here oh yeah jing jingudal you just they just want you to think that this tranny is so magical that wild animals are gonna run over and hug her these these vicious wild beasts their idols and their jokes and their trannies prominently displaying the hidden hand doesn't this doesn't look the same as today the old ones look different little nap pan backwards Darwin's missing link that's why they came up with this so this was interesting chimp named enoc and I think that they look bad I think that the old ones old ones shouldn't look worse that's not how real life works if you take a picture of a squirrel from the 1920s it's not gonna look like a worse squirrel but the chimps look worse and I'll say yeah it was a it's a great deception they put a lot of effort this is where they put a lot of their effort into things like this fooling the public into thinking that they're just a monkey taking away from God things that can take you away from God is where they put in huge amounts of effort to gaslight you look they're bad this one doesn't seem to have fangs and the first suit just looks cheaper just look at the first suit it doesn't look as good always a bunch of sinister looking people holding these chimps like little baby dolls these are probably just dolls look at the hips too there's some weird thing out of Kellogg's are you gonna have a wild animal next to your little baby no it's a hoax their feet just look like these limp sausage things it's because that's just a fake that's not a real animal foot if monkey if chimpanzees were real they would have grip they would be gripping on to things with their feet but they're always just these lifeless sausage things in this one look at the hand it's just a human hand sometimes it's just a realistic looking mask just on a human body you can just see that this is just a human body with a mask on it the hands it just looks like they have some fur and they painted them just elaborate suits to me they look really dry like like a real animal wouldn't look so dry maybe they're powdered up or something for the Hollywood effects this just looks like it's a human body some of them they just threw fur on a human body with a realistic looking face mask look at the arms that's just a human arm this one's just a human body with hair this one too it's just a human body these were from the 1960s and I'll just end with animatronic chimps they have extenders they'll wear you can find all sorts of videos online of people pretending to be apes learning how to be apes and it's because that's it's a real thing that people do it's a real acting gig people really do go pretend to be apes all day in enclosures at a zoo it really is you being watched they're watching you get fooled go less

The official, the original, home for Cone Shandy. Find all the Cones you can handle at ConeWatch.com. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. So, D.L., I guess you are saying that Trump is the only president that takes pictures with celebrities. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. It is amazing to me. If Donald Trump cares about black people, then he will take pictures with celebrities. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. It is amazing to me. If Donald Trump cares about black people, he wouldn't have denigrated the president with those claims of birth arisen. He wouldn't have stoked fears and racist fears of saying this man is less than or is not one of us to become president. If Donald Trump cares about the concerns of black people, he wouldn't have in the debates talked about bringing back stop and frisk. Stop and frisk. Now that's a valid point. But D.L. is more concerned about his lover Obama than real black matters. Check out this love fest. Millions and millions whilst the president gave his farewell address to the nation, I think it was full of optimism. Optimism. Wasn't the president Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of hope. Oh, again, are we talking about President Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of nostalgia. I think it was the reason all the reasons that we loved him and followed him for eight years. If Donald Trump cared about black people, Jeff Sessions would most certainly not be his pick to head the Justice Department. Donald Trump takes pictures with black people. Having a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community. D.L. didn't president Obama meet with a rapper, Jay Z, a football player, a whole lot of them. And a comedian, you, if you still consider one. And a few boogie shapers, Fergie and Beyoncé. All while denying the black caucus access to him and putting his bulldog, Reverend L. Shorpton on them if they dare step out of line. You know why you have a comedian, a rapper, and a football player out to talk about the concerns of community? Because that's the position you used to seeing us in. You would rather see a football player, a rapper, and a comedian. So what happens if a rapper, a football player, and a comedian enter an Obama inauguration party? The rapper's wife will show you her ASS. You'd rather have black people with football players, comedians, and rappers than the president. You'd rather see us run the ball than run the country. That's why you do it. I ain't gonna never forget what you said about this man and how you got where you are. Some people might, but I never will. I'll never forget how you denigrated his family. I'll never forget how you stoke fears. Fuck you now and fuck you forever. Yeah, a really dumb, strong, tough destiny. Maybe he's upset that Trump is not his white daddy. So let's watch this cool, this is mama, and show love for his white daddy. I want to have one, I've got it to my mother. And she did the apple. She said this apple's rotten. Just like you are. And I laughed and I told him that story said, you know, right? You're gonna be something. And I'll never forget that. And I hope he has proud of me that. Get job, get job. Get job, get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. Get job. So this cool, this is mama and share some tears for his white daddy. Typical blind side, green mile, the hell, hidden figures, white savior, cool shit. But he's not through with black women. Let's wrap up with this cool clowning, black college girls. So he could get approval from another white daddy. We call them holes and, uh, a navigated hose and they weren't holes. But it was some navigated women on that team. Shut up. I'm gonna say it. I don't give a damn y'all like it or not. You know, it's true. Them is some of the ugly women I ever seen in my home. Get the hell out of here. Call that bell. I don't want a big cool no mo. I'm gonna say it here. Cool man. Niggas. Listen to your boys and girls. I got something for you. Don't worry about getting no black men, little girl. Don't worry about getting no black women, little boy. When you go up, don't worry about your kids. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to do is do some girls with white folks. And the white folks love you. If they love you, you'll be our right child. You'll be with God. Come and watch. You'll fish you the original home for cone shame.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_417.mp3:  On Zwarmer Hat, I just want to show you this intro to a show called Lancelot Link Secret Chimp. Thank you to a subscriber for joining me this. It's really absurd. It's back in a time when chimps didn't have the danger element. The 70s were a pretty wacky time and they hadn't yet written it into the bio of chimps that they can be super aggressive and rip people's face off and all that. We see that with the fake animals, the lore changes. Just like the look will change, they'll make up new stories that never used to exist. One that I always think of as sloths, they like to talk about how sloths grow moss on their back these days. They never used to talk about that. And nowadays you can find really absurd looking photoshopps where they just like spray some green on the back. If you go watch old footage of sloths, they never talk about the moss thing and they don't have moss on their backs. So just like that chimps, they eventually realized, hey, they like to put a danger element to make people scared and stay away. If you make something scary, it makes it really easy for people to stay away from it. I mean, just realistically, these big animals shouldn't be so easily trainable and friendly all the time. It really is absurd. So they had to put a danger element into it. That's why they have hook stories of people falling in the enclosures and they have hook stories of people that have these as pets. Nobody has a chimps as a pet. It's not a real thing. It's a fur suit. And look at the one eye symbolism we have here. There's a bunch of one eye symbolism in this opening and I'll just I'll play it.

You are chemically infuckin' balanced. Take your medication. You missing the illest white bitch. Why? She's mentally imbalanced. It's real. Take your medication white bitch. You're so mad over a word. You dirty nigger? It was your word that you're getting out of it. What about the red neck that exists in that country? It sounds like you have some real emotional problems. You're gonna be on your knee, suckin' on whatever dick you can get your fucking mouth. Nothing to say matters to me. She won't touch a nigger's dick. I can promise you, bro. I'm not a nigger's dick. The fact that she's on an acting race is chemically imbalanced. She's not acting. Neither of us are acting. Yeah, if you racist, if you racist, then you obsessed with black men. You probably hate black men. I hate black men. You know, just trust me. You see that wig on your head, we don't like that. We don't like that wig on your head. Oh, that's so big, sir.

Nigger, let's hear it. I would actually step in if you were saying anything that like... I actually thought was bad towards her, but you're not. You're saying the same chimp out shit that every nigger says to her. Yeah, because I'm speaking fake, not picking facts, dude. All white people are chemically embedded. Jala races for no reason. Black folks do not sit in the blue talking about white people. Or races because you've been burning down our cities for the past year. Did he say unedged, mucated? You're talking your mom, but get your senior on it. You're making little too no sense. You're making little too no sense, sir. I don't care.

Yeah, they're my life. The one that's also in an hospital. Oh my god, he almost knew what they're helping. Bro, you look like a fucking Auschwitz survivor. But I'm married. I'm not a young nigger. I'm talking. Y'all still fucking. Y'all still got a fucking dying grillionaire at all. Y'all say you're watching. Y'all laugh. What? Is he bragging about? What? Yeah, I got nothing.

Is this the are you done bro? Are you done? I'm telling you I know why people broke up. They're racist. They are mentally ill. That's it. They can sit down with them. That's not it. Wait, if we're mentally ill, can I collect disability checks from my racism? That'd be sick. Let me hit a lick on those mental disability checks. Just tell them. Just tell them that you have issues. Some of you have a super black face. Yeah, I have issues with Niggas. That's right. You right. You right. Yeah, bro. I don't know. How to explain. It's a different between a neighbor and a black man. Because you're a man. There is no difference. Listen, you're so mentally ill is that you're comparing black people to what. So anyway. Okay, here, what do you what do you call a black man with a PhD? You want to you want to you could talk to a little bit. What does he and the white man asked your question, respect him when he talks? Yeah, what do you call a black man with a PhD? Yeah, they mentally ill. You said I preached the Bible to them. They don't believe in God. I believe in God. I love God. God. Yeah, I'm one of God's people. Yeah, yeah, you love God, but you're talking down on God's creation. You're mentally ill. All of you are. You're not God's creation. You're a fucking ape. I'm a God's creation, but I'm killing earth. I think everything just called earth is killing back. I feel like I feel like I feel like I feel like when you talk and then maybe you are like the seven player of hell, but yeah, there's definitely no niggers and have a PhD. Definitely not. It's monkey. We talk to random people and in this random. And the dude on the right. It's not my first time seeing a talk down on other black folks. He doesn't know this is no, this is what he does. I live on this. This is not my first time talking to this raw man. Yeah, he won't talk one of the screaming. Not a streamer. He's mentally ill, man. No, I don't. You said you talked to him. He got to take his medication. I keep telling him like, bro, he even asked me. Yeah, he can make money off of talking to him. Yeah. Isn't it amazing how we can make money off of being racist and niggers? I'm not listening to you. I have no reason to listen to you. Nothing you say is going to benefit me in any way. I like how they got the mom shipping out to now. We got the whole family. Except for the dad. Except for the dad. Is it what? The dad's probably not there. You know, like not around with my mother. My father's upstairs. You want to get to see my father? Your dad's there. That's. He's always saying for my mother. Hey, he's always so happy. So what, you're living in your mom's house? Is that what you're saying? He's living with his mother and his house. He's really free. He's free. Got that. And we take care of my mother. This time. Hit daddy of steps. You grew up with one. Sorry. So he's not a mother. It's difficult. That's fantastic. He's not a statistic. But you see what even the mom speaks any bonus. Listen. You're not a mother. That's what I'm saying. I don't care who you are. No one. No one. I never said that. I don't have a father. My mother. You need a close battery. God bless you. I don't care who you are. No one. I don't care. No one. I never said that. I never said that. I never said that. I never said that. I never said that. I don't have a father. I wanted to get the dad to chimp out too. Did you get him? Did you record that? Yeah. I recorded that. That's going to be a good one. That one. I got the whole family chimp in. Geez. That's a new record for us. Like, yeah, we've got it. Oh, God. What? What were they called? The fucking monkey packs? A troop. We found a troop. We finally got a fucking troop. Oh, my gosh. I'm so proud of us. We started like small, you know? Just one nigger at a time. Slowly but surely. Working our way up until we finally found a troop. Hopefully this time it'll be like a game. Like a whole bunch of black dudes together. Committing crime or something. Yeah. They just got back from hitting a lick as they like to say. Ha ha.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_239.mp3:  Thanks to the Jews at the FCC, you can say just about anything on TV, but one word still draws in dignity. It's the word for the apes in the inner city. You know, the ones they're the underprivileged sword, the famous ones usually wrap or play sports. You deal with them only as a last resort, and thanks to all the guns, their life spans our short. They struggle with logic, they can't grasp reason, their favorite game is rioting during the warm season. You made call them teens or protesters or Jews, but those are lies we tell ourselves to want to use hate the truth. They're niggers, they're niggers, they're motherfucking niggers, pretend all you want, but you still know they're niggers. Fuck insipid euphemisms, let's not be vague. Call them what they are, a humanoid plague. Whenever there's a problem, niggers are to blame. A well-trained dog with some niggers to shame. Niggers we thought of the clubs and bars, by acting like the damn orangutans they are. Niggers are the same, niggers are the problem. Niggers were only good for picking white men's cotton. As a matter of fact, they were even bad at that. Let's load up the niggers and send the niggers back. The mind of the normie is a place of dissonance, purported free thinkers who silence dissidents, serenal erotic to the core, and you to the prank. Consider the retard should your average normie thinks. A man becomes a woman by cutting off a stick, but racial crimes in the sticks make the normie go ballistic. Time for some knowledge you didn't learn in class. If it comes to it, I'll show this fucking red pill of your ass. Let's see, there's 40,000 fair chips in our nation with IQs lower than ours by a standard deviation. The average nigger hasn't read a single fucking book, the majority of niggers are criminals and books. For example, if we remove them all today, half the murders in the USA would go away. Niggers is proportionately rape-killed, robbed two drugs and get well-air. Without holding just, this is all verifiable. Reality hurts, but what can you expect from someone who's the color of dirty? In light of all of that, just while the fucking triggered, call them what they are, white man. Just say niggers whenever there's a problem. Niggers are to blame. A well-trained dog puts a nigger to shame. Niggers really miss a civ and Louisiana by making things up. And jumping for bananas, niggers are the same. Niggers are the problem. Niggers were only good for picking white men's cotton. As a matter of fact, they were even bad at that. Let's all deduct the nigger books and send niggers back here to deal with this while it's a clear correct shit. It's about much more than being in-offensive. Pay attention. The dots will soon be connected. We use to have a nation until Jews and niggers like it. When Jews release our language, it's a form of control. Two subjugate hour minds is their final goal. If the words describing something are removed from your brain, then attempts to discuss it will all be in vain. You can't call us names, make call and make a no. Their Vanguard are retards with social justice once. Thanks to the truth, we can discuss like you. But everyone's still, but Blacks are dumper and locks. It's not about their game is much nigger. It's not about pretending fat humps from getting triggered. We're still to do angel. Yours ain't coming. Come on, white man. Just call them niggers. Just call them niggers. Fucking niggers. Fucking niggers. Fucking niggers. Not by a fucking nigger. Fucking nigger. Fucking nigger. Nigger nigger. If I call you a nigger, does that affect you? Hey niggers. What's a nigger? Faggot. Nigger. Nigger nigger. Nigger nigger. Smunky nigger. Just call them niggers. Who? Nigger is the beautiful one. It's not acceptable to call them niggers. Just call them niggers. Fucking niggers. Fucking niggers. Nigger. Not by a fucking nigger. Fucking nigger. Fucking nigger. You? Nigger nigger. Nigger nigger. If I call you a nigger, does that affect you? Hey niggers. What's a nigger? Faggot. Nigger. Love her nigger nigger. Nigger. Smunky nigger. Just call them niggers. The word nigger is a beautiful one. It's not acceptable to call them nigger.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_615.mp3:  On August 18th at the Ramada Hotel in Central Jerusalem, leading Israeli rabbis gathered to defend the publication of a book by one of their peers that cited rabbinic sources to justify the killing of non-Jews, including innocent children and families. Also because of their licenses, they resisted them, while found in the matterwią with the Videos, into which they had no relations witheds for this. Everyone would love thanks of the scar or death of a women. Neither Christians and history were worthy of meeting the published title for the first time this is all about the cause. The joy about living on establishing a dream and he comes here to terrified this sort of people of some kind. So what did you do? Well, as I was wondering, I saw this scene several times, some people think that was a good idea, and that this is the push to the side, a source of�itiness, and 24 something changes I am glad that the Was<|he|> voter system is as so easy as far as the wall to the majority And what happened here, what this was, what happened here. This was a Khilul Krodeh Taurah. It was a desecration of the Torah. The Torah is a Torah of peace, dark and no-am. And what we heard here was that most of the people didn't read the book. And they said what's important is the asmulta Torah. It said nobody should criticize anybody who writes anything about it, especially if he's a Ralph. And what we're saying is we've read the book. We know what the book says. The book calls for killing innocent children. There's no fine distinctions made here. It's a book of racist statements in the name of the Torah. But there is such a concept in Jewish laws and in the population. And under very specific circumstances according to various rabbinic opinions, it would be seemingly permissible to kill children.\n",

I just want to say when I first heard you a long time ago I used to think to myself. I said man, this guy he's these are cool. He's awkward time But as I started to listen to you more I started to see how much since you made Amazing and what have you realized from the sense that I make? Basically I realized that right now I'm in a fallen state and the reason why I'm calling is because I'm asking for advice I haven't I haven't seen my father in four years and I've been angry with him for over 20 years And I just want to know how to go about forgiving him as you've been talking about and why have you been angry at him for 20 years? What did he do to you? Basically We just ever since I was a child we never had a good relationship. We are Often he would often go overboard with any type of discipline or anything like that and How hard would resentment that he favored my my younger brothers More than he did me. So that's why I had always had that anger at me and What and you mean as that of him gone overboard with our discipline? I Will basically a lot of times he would tell me that I was a sorry excuse for a son or that out of all his guns and I discussed in him so You know stuff like that that would just make me angry are you the oldest? Yes, and are you the closest to your mother? Well, we had a yes That's why he felt that way you identify with your mother and he probably saw you as being a weak boy Because you act like your mother and he Judge you because he you act like the woman that he hated and Go to him find him and Let him know I'm sorry for resent you for that. I understand now You act like your mother you identified. That doesn't make it right for what he did to you the way he treated you But he hated your mother because he married to his mother his mother Your mother is his mother Because man married women that like their mothers because they resent their mothers and then when they get with them They become like little boys and if they can't get past the mother they become violent or they start to cheat or they leave Or all of the above so you identify with your mother. That's why he did that to you All right, make sense and then just let him know I did understand why you treated me so badly. I now understand It was a right to where you treated me, but I'm wrong for holding it against you. I realize you can help yourself Okay, I'll basically I'll go ahead and do that. I can tap the basic bake my way down the Virginia so that I can do that Yeah, don't argue with him if he agrees fine if he doesn't find Uh If he explains to you explain to you what happened that'll be good But forgive him Lord in your whole life will change you come back to yourself and there's nothing like being you you're gonna have perfect peace within All right, thank you very much Jesse. Let me know how it goes I will okay, but I wish you well All right, right now amazing, huh? Absolutely Amazing\n",

The suggestion is that it is somehow possible to separate whiteness from oppression, and it is not. There can be no white race without the phenomenon of white supremacy. If you abolish slavery, you abolish slaveholders. In the same way, if you abolish racial oppression, you do away with whiteness. Trees into whiteness is loyalty to humanity. Your views are fairly well received in academia. Yes, they legit admit not to say that everyone agrees, but sure. I could not point to any examples where it has provoked political censorship. The whiteness is an identity that arises entirely out of oppression. Whiteness is not a culture, it's not a religion, it's not a language, it's simply an oppressive social category. Blackness is an identity that can be plausibly argued. Black studies is a study of a people that has formed itself in resistance to its oppression. The task is to bring this minority together in such a way that it makes it impossible for the legacy of whiteness to continue to reproduce itself. This point in time, Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural, and I think we're going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are not going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role, but without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_577.mp3:  Hardline religious group Matei Irguneh Hamidash or headquarters of the Temple organizations has a mission to rebuild a Jewish House of Warship on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Currently home to Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, the location has been long contested between the two religions. The Jewish group however maintains that the location is key for fulfilling biblical prophecies. It is a new start of the redemption and we hope the text here or even before we will be on the Temple Mount. The law will come from here. All the 17 nations they will have a seat in the court and the law will be the law of the Bible. On a rainy day before Passover, the organization gathers on a rooftop in the old city to carry out a controversial practice, ritual sacrifice. Under the watch of high security, the sheep is brought to a secluded area. Religious followers continue to make final preparations. We're on another milestone in the process of the return of the Jewish people to their homeland. The young men playing the role of priests dress in biblical looking clothes. It's now time to begin. Everyone gathers to pray as the priests re-enact ancient traditions from the Bible. The event that takes place here is not an event in itself. It's a practice. It's a training and people are coming here to learn to understand. The blood of the eye of the public, the sheep is slaughtered. Its blood is brought out for ritual use. And maybe this year, in four days later, the representative of the groups of the Israelis will come with their lamb to the yards of their temple. We build a kosher altar and start all the ritual of pesser lambs. To complete the sacrifice, the lamb is skinned and displayed for the group. The body is cooked to be eaten later that night.\n",

It could be done, of course, but I hope that all the right-wing people will not develop. And this is for example a job for an artist.

And he has the tape. The music is so loud. The music is so loud. Those are the words that he told us that he would never use again. Plus, they read Jackson promised several months ago to revise the lyrics to his song they don't care about us. lyrics many called anti-Semitic. Jackson's in Brazil now shooting the video for the song and entertainment tonight has learned he is still using the controversial lyrics. It is Mark Steinus as the story force. Michael Jackson arrived at the location of his music video under an umbrella to protect you from the sun and with two children by his side. He was in Brazil to shoot the music video for his song they don't care about us. Last year he angered Jewish groups when he sang these words. Michael then gave in to pressure and changed the song. But in Brazil the controversial lyrics were back and he sang it this way. We showed footage of the video shoots a rabbi Marvin Hyer and activist for Jewish causes who was outraged because last June Jackson sent him a letter of apology for singing those lyrics. I'm shocked. Junmi, Sumi, kick me, kite me. Those are the words that he told us that he would never use again. Now, I have a CD that he sent me with the words eliminated. Why couldn't he do the same thing in Brazil? Last year Michael said the intention of the song was to say no to racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. But he did change the lyrics. Prior to shooting we asked director Spike Lee which version he would sing. You have to ask Michael, I don't know. I just work for him. But by singing words that angered so many people Michael is sure to enter another firestorm. His spokesman Bob Jones says it's his super stardom that makes him a target. The bigger he has gotten, the bigger the shots. And of course, as I said, when Christ did things to free the oppressed people and they tried to destroy him also. He arrived in Rio, Shanny, town, slums by private helicopter. The crowds were enthusiastic and Michael delivered at energetic performance. Earlier, Brazilian officials denied Jackson of visa because they feared his shooting the video there would be bad publicity for the country. But Spike Lee tells ET that all this flap is not what he and Michael had in mind when they decided to shoot in Brazil. We didn't really court this controversy. No way in a world to leave, or we were flying halfway around the world to the drag brazil or his people through the mud. And now there's another controversy for Michael. Newspapers in Rio say Jackson paid protection money to the cocaine kingpin who runs that poor neighborhood for permission to shoot the video. Spike Lee says someone was paid. And no who? And Michael Jackson, as usual, isn't saying anything. John and Mary. Thank you, Mark. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_165.mp3:  Good evening and welcome to a new video. We're going to have a look at two Wakandans in a McDonald's having an epic chip out. And this is a chip out to end all chip out. Epic chip out time. So let's see how these Wakandans act in this. McDonald's in deepest darkest Chicago presumably. Nishonda Johnson has spent the last month reflecting on the worst day of her more than 10 year career with McDonald's. Early fucker Wakandan held a job done for 10 years. Must be some sort of record. I say good share. It was here at the Colrain Township location near Ronald Reagan highway where she was part of the now infamous over the counter food fight. Brittany Price says she waited for an incorrect food order to be fixed and eventually threw bags of food at Nishonda. How not to get a refund at McDonald's for your happy beer or across the counter and a chocolate shake as well. That's why the way not to get a refund you're after Wakandan. Brittany suffered a shattered cheekbone and broken nose when Nishonda chucked a blender at her and it ricocheted off. Dang Bullseye the Wakandans down I say. Per face. Pardon me. I see that again. That was beautiful. Ruler's the soft. Nishonda chucked a blender at her and everything on her face. I say good shot was just very aggressive, very intensive. Of course you had chilled out. You risk calm as a. He knew cow. And almost the meaning. Even though we can see you tripping out on video. Laya. Nishonda remembers it differently. She don't want started this and want to never went down like. Look at that hair hat. Fuck me. It's no way that's your real hair love. What's that? What 100% polyester? Fuck me. It looks ridiculous. Taking a fucking finger of your head. That if she want to never do stuff at me. She says it was shift changed and she was in the back with the general manager verifying money. Nishonda says she asked the general manager to handle the situation so she could finish. No, what happened was you said let this bitch wait. She's been giving me an extra to as a proud welcome. Then I'm going to give her an attitude and make her wait 20 minutes before she gets a refund. Until she loses her shit and throws a happy bill at me. And then I retaliate by throwing a blender in her face. That's what happened. You're like come on, be honest. Nishonda, stop doing what you're doing. Just go up there and get rid of the refund. So I'm like carrying some of that get up there. It's trying to blow up. You hear that she up there just going off cussing. Is that because you left there for 20 minutes because you were trying to be a bitch? She just wanted to refund. It's being real our way down real rude up there. Nishonda says she could hear cussing and she approached the counter and talked to her. Oh, look at that. It's calm as a Hindu cow. Look at that. She's just politely waiting. Look, not chipping out at all. Even though it totally looks like she's chipping out. The Brittany about exchanging the food. She also says only managers have the code to process refunds which added to Brittany's more than just trying to get a refund. I have the power in this situation. The general manager of this situation was giving me a new deal. Fuck you. Take a happy bill. Ah. The way from the register going to the back. She just started assaulting me from the back. She thought, um, chocolate milk and hit me in the hair with it. As I had my back turned so I turned around. They come to apple juice, hit me in the face. All the happy meals in the brown paper bags. She just started going crazy. So very action have a reaction. So why I'm getting a. Yeah, a reaction. Coz the opposite reaction. But doesn't mean you throw a blender as a customer's face. Miss. Nigeria 1992. Like. It's just not on. That's why I would never hire a. A raconda in my hand about Donald's because I would be afraid that she might throw a fucking blender at my customer's face. No, you know, I think that was a slight overreaction there. No, you feel that was reasonable, dude? Yeah. God, I just picked up anything that was right. Bang! There she goes. Oh, bullseye. Back at her. She says she's not real. Oh, no, she's down. Do you regret throwing anything? Yeah, I do because I miss my job. That's what I do. As Nishanda looks for a new job, Brittany sets more doctor's appointments. It's a pain. Bang. That's what a blender does. It's a lot of outcome. I never had no incident like this. Never because I always be able to diffuse the situation to whatever it is. They fool wrong. We cheat them out of money. Her always. Bang! Then she goes. Oh, dear. I know she's down there, dear.\n",

Most of the generation Trump, the alt-right people, the people who like me... No, I mean, I've never identified as your alt-right. They're not anti-Semites. They don't care about Jews. They mean they may have some assumptions about Jews. They may have some prejudice about Jews, like the Jews run everything. Well, we do. The Jews run all the banks. Well, we do. The Jews run the media. Well, we do. You know, I mean, they're right about all that stuff. Now, what you do with that is the issue. But the reason they go on about... I don't even know where to start with that. So just go... We do. It's a fact. This is not in debate. It's a statistical fact. You know, Jews run most of the banks. Jews completely dominate the media. Varsely, disproportionately represented in all of these professions. That's just a fact. It's not anti-Semitic to point out statistics. But, you know, you seem to have... You know, you've missed... What you agree with me on a feminism, like it's not... ...resexist to point out statistics. I'm suggesting to you, it's not anti-Semitic to point out that these things are true. Now, the anti-Semitism on the internet is really important. I want people to understand this, because nobody seems to. When Jonah Goldberg of National Review, whatever, is bombarded by these memes... LAUGHTER ...of whatever it is. Yeah. And anti-Semitic, you know, take a hike, all this kind of stuff. It's not because there is a gigantic outpouring, a spontaneous outpouring of anti-Semitism from 22 roles in this country. What it is is that it's a mischievous, dissident, you know, trolley generation who do it because it gets a reaction. LAUGHTER As what is your opinion on Jewish influence in the media? There it is. There's the Jew question. Yep. There it sits. I don't... People who are obsessed with Jews controlling the world never seem to present any evidence. I mean, I read the news every day. I track narratives that the mainstream media comes out with. I don't see a big Jewish influence. I mean, Jewish people aren't really that present. You don't really notice them anywhere.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_603.mp3:  So let's look at... we're going to transition now from looking at just symbolism to looking at word play. And this is something that many people won't get because they're too left-brained and balanced and can't see the dynamic of what is known as green language. Or if you want to look this up, look up the language of the birds. This is alchemical pun language. It is not meant to be taken, 100% totally literally, nor even as the direct intent of the people who came up with a specific word. It could also be an example of synchromysticism working itself out in the universe to bring certain things to our attention. And we need to be conscious enough to recognize the pattern. This is why the alchemist called it the language of the birds. It's something you have to be quiet to hear. You have to have a balanced brain to be able to interpret or read this language. It is verbal, but it is verbal and symbolic simultaneously. Green language, which we left off talking about last week, is symbolic word pun or word play language. This does not necessarily have to be deliberately constructed by the person who constructed any given language. It seems that this type of word pun language, which is called either alchemical language or green language, it is also sometimes referred to as the language of the birds. And this is another pun because it's the language of birds, of people who are coming forward using their voice to speak truths into creation. So, green language or alchemical language, first of all, does not have to be deliberately intended. It could be, as I mentioned last week, an example of what is known as synchromysticism, which is the seemingly mundane is somehow speaking to us through language, through symbol, through sometimes through art.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_165.mp3:  But Dr. Steve Patenekas, we're in the middle of this. The elections over. We're now in the stealing process of the election. What are you seeing? What's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax? Let me just say again what I said in 2016. There are honorable members of our intelligence, military and civilian community in the government who understood exactly how corrupt Biden and the Democratic machinery is, was and will be. This is really a sting operation. Contrary to what everybody else said, Trump knew this was happening. Eric knew this was happening and warned the public. I knew this was happening. However, I could not say anything about it. What happened was we marked, watermarked every ballot with what's called the QFS block chain encryption code. In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went, and who has it. So this is not a stolen election on the contrary. We reversed the entire game of war along the lines of Sunsuk, the art of war, and Trump was brilliant and still is brilliant added. The reason he hasn't been seen in Alex correctly said, oh, I haven't seen him in several days. Well, in the art of the war, you pull back, allow your enemy to make all the mistakes that they are making. Manipulate the situation, expose them, and then come in for the final killing. And that's what's happening now. None of this was unexpected. All of this was expected. All of this is part of the sting operation we're running. And let me tell you that 48 hours ago, not only did we put markers on those ballots, but I can say now with the permission of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere that we have sent out thousands and thousands of national guards to 12 different states, Washington, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, Alabama and everywhere. So now you have to consider and rethink what this is really about. The genius of Trump is that he is able to pull back at any point and manipulate the opponent without the opponent ever realizing. He has said repeatedly hashtags steal the vote. That's exactly what he has said for months. Then he made a very clear implication. He said, I will use common sense or my intelligence, i.e. both literal and figurative intelligence. And those of us in the intelligence community be it who they are. Again, what I said in 2016, when we exposed Hillary Clinton, we now exposed, and it was Trump who initiated this Biden family, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden, Frank, the whole family who was played right into a game where they were convicted and you've seen what's happening now. What was not announced was that we order marked all the ballots with what I said at the QFS blockchain, which is a very hard encryption code to break. And the second thing is we sent is I probably 20,000 or more a national guards 48 hours ago. None of it was reported and I thank the press for not reporting it and others. So what in fact is happening is you're seeing a sophisticated sting operation that was initiated by Trump. I'm just a lowly peasant in this game. And honestly, I was informed that I could say something about it today only last night. That's why I could not come on. Well, you just a reverse of what you guys have been thinking. It's not a civil war. We have not been surprised in any way. This has been a setup by Trump for a long, long time in the same way that we knew about Hillary Clinton. I warned about the coup that we we would do it counted to and this is our county to again against the Biden's. And that's exactly what we expected. The corruption in the mail, the corruption of USPS, we corruption with the Democrats everywhere and anywhere. There was no surprise here. And that's why we deployed national guards soldiers to 12 different states. Well, Steve, you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news since the election here on this show are arrests inevitably coming down the road. They're coming not just down the road. They're being implemented. What you saw, Corey, when Dowsden and beyond the scene when they were in Clay County and as well in Philadelphia, that was not just a threat. That was exactly what's going to happen. People will be arrested as of tonight, tomorrow, and it will go on for quite a while. And this was a total sting operation that I can say. So I explain to anybody else. As I have the permission to say it, I do not deal with classified information. As you know, I do not work for our government, but because I'm loyal to the Republic, and I work with a lot of people who are loyal to this Republic, including the 16 intelligent services, the secret service, our civilian service. They've all been great and they've kept it quiet. And I've been given the permission to say what I just said. I have nothing more to say, but this is not a surprise here. This is the biggest sting operation probably in our country that we've ever had. So how is this watermark on the ballots? What is the significance of that as to is it going to stop from fake ballots being counted or how is that going to be used? Well, we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of counting, knowing which ones were fake, which ones were not. It's a very sophisticated code. So if you just throw them away, these are cyber communication implementations that we have the code for. We know exactly what was thrown away. We know exactly what was placed. We know exactly who has it and we know exactly where it went. I can't go any further than that.\n",

It was a desecration of the Torah. The Torah is a Torah of peace, dark and noam. And what we heard here was that most of the people didn't read the book. And they said, what's important is the asmrut of Torah. It said nobody should criticize anybody who writes anything about it, especially if he's a Ralph. And what we're saying is we've read the book. We know what the book says. The book calls for killing innocent children. There's no fine distinctions made here. It's a book of racist statements in the name of the Torah. The story of a p Nestorah's static theoryesis приветes over a large number of stories affected by the lyrics of history the first of long time books reached. That's why we can't comment on it like that. But, in this video there are pirates coming out deep into the form of a enforced��운 relationship. and under very specific circumstances according to various rabbinic opinions, it would be seemingly permissible to kill children.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_367.mp3:  What is up YouTube? John Kristani here gonna show you how to build an email list for marketing without a website. No website needed for this in under 10 minutes. I'll be going over a few things with you today. Showing you free email marketing program that you can use. I'll also be showing you how you can create a sign up form that's hosted on its own landing page. Even if you don't have a website there's no need to register a website to make this happen. I'll also be showing you how to create your email marketing campaign. I'll be giving you a free bonus at the end to help you get started making money with email marketing. So stay tuned keep watching. Let's get into it. Once again this is going to be a pretty hot video because we're going to be going over how to build an email list without even having a website. So this is pretty excited. And also we're going to do it in under 10 minutes. Can you start the time? Yeah. Okay cool. So we got the timer started. First go into the free email marketing program. And the free email marketing program we will be using. Let's go over to my computer is called MailChimp. Now MailChimp is free to sign up for free to use. And as you can see right here MailChimp all in one marketing platform. You just click on that in Google. I couldn't find an affiliate program for them. Otherwise I would have put an affiliate link below but there might be a link in the description. And what you do is you just click this button in the top right corner like all programs. Sign up for free right up there to get started. Now keep in mind there's a lot of additional resources that they have available for you to learn email marketing. And I'm going to be going over the basics. So you can always go deeper in in their resource. Now the first thing you do once you get signed in the MailChimp is you need to create an audience for basically an audience is kind of like a list or a segment whatever you want to call it. But you'll go up here to the top left corner and you'll click create. Now once you're logged in the MailChimp the first thing you'll do is you'll need to create an audience which is also known as an email list. So in order to create an email list or an audience will scroll down in the main camp main area you just click this button and it'll say audience and write down here it says create a list. So we're going to want to click that button right there to start creating our email list. So we'll click create a list. And in here we'll want to say what our audience name is. So let's just say I don't know Tito diet. I recently have been on the Tito diet. You know eating lots of nuts, vegetables and meat, no carbs. Lost 15 pounds in the last two months, 15 pounds in two months. So pretty cool. I was getting a little bit there for a while. I saw some of you commenters making fun of it. So you'll set up your audience name here and then you'll do your default from address. So let's just say I'm John Robert, Kristani at gmail.com. Everybody send me emails. I love getting personal emails from all you and if you need money anybody who sends me an email asking for money I give money to. So default from name we'll just say, Kristani, and you set up your information right down here. Okay, then you just click save. So we have an audience now. We have an audience named Keto diet. Now the next step that we actually take is we're going to actually need to create a landing page. So what you need to do up here is we're going to go up and click create. Then we will go down here to where it says landing page. And this is going to be a page that allows you to collect emails on it to go into your list. So let's call our landing page name. Keto LP LP stands for landing page and then we click begin right here. Now here we've arrived at a spot where we can select a number of different styles. It depends on I don't know what do you think looks best. Let's just say this wild country looks like the best fit. So we might say get fit and lose weight and we will change this. So we click that and then the button text will say get free information sent to your email now. Free information sent to your email now. Learn how I lost 15 pounds in two months on the keto diet. Maybe I want to make a font Georgia and maybe I want to make it a little bit bigger so that it shows up bigger. You can do a lot of things with this. Maybe you want to make it bold or callicized or underlined. Whatever you want to do you can do. And even if you want it to change the picture you could change the image to something else. We're not going to do all of that right now but the point being you can have a lot of fun with these templates and customize them how you want. What you do once you're done is you can click save and close right in the lower corner. So to finish it setting up you need to add a page title and you need to create a URL for your page. So we're just going to add a page title lose weight on the keto diet and then we will add URL. We'll click this final step right there. So we'll just say use MailChimp domain and we will say keto diet. Then we will click save. So make sure once again you want to click use MailChimp domain. This way you can do this without having your own website and you can collect emails which you can mark it to. Voila! Here we go. So here's our page and here's our link and you really want to save this link because this is pretty important right here. This link will go to your page. So you have a free web page right now. You have a free web page that people can sign up for and opt in on. Okay so now we finish all of the things all we need to do now is actually click publish. So I'm going to save I'm going to save this URL and I'm going to click publish and high five. It says our landing pages on the web. So let's check it out. And here we go. Look our web pages already on live. We can enter in, you know, let's just say I'm going to say Henry Royal at gmail.com. We could say subscribe. Success. You've been added to the audience. And if we go in our campaign builder here we can actually go under the dashboard and we can see, well it might take a second to update, but basically it will show us that we just added a subscriber. And we have a web page. We have an email list we can mail to. We have everything we need to actually start marketing. Now how do you actually start marketing to people though? So last step is you'll want to go under create right here and you would do design and send regular or automated emails to your subscribers. And from there you go through the step by step process of being able to create that. Woo so that should have been under 10 minutes. That may have even been under five, but in that you just learn how to build an email list. Set it up without a website in under 10 minutes and it's for marketing. Meaning the people are opting in. It's going to be GDPR compliant. You can market to these people. The difference with marketing is they opt in. If they don't opt in to be an email list you're technically violating spam laws when you send an email to them. So we're using MailChimp. There's a lot of other email service providers. I personally recommend SendGrid. SendGrid is first of all it's run by a freaking animal like just genius Isaac. He's amazing. And if you haven't seen interviews of Isaac Salgata went to UC Riverside not too far from where I live in Malibu. Well it's in Southern California. He's amazing entrepreneur. He's got amazing vision and he's built an amazing company which does email better than any other company on the internet. But MailChimp is great to start. You build a sign up form. You build a landing page. Sign up form and landing page. Website without having to register your own website. And you created an email campaign. I'm going to give you a bonus. I said I was going to give you a bonus. And the bonus is I want to work with you. I actually want to work with you. I want to make money together. I want to be partners. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to encourage you to build email lists. Helping people learn ways they can earn money from home. Because this is a big problem. There are a lot of people still going to jobs. A lot of people doing long commutes to work every day. And frustrated and don't like it. There's a lot of parents still telling their kids to be nurses, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and a lot of kids that go into those professions and learn that they hate it. I want to show people how they can make money from home. And I want you to help me. And you're going to get 90% of the commissions. And I'm going to get 10%. I still end up making out alright. My JV page and information on how to be an affiliate working with me. My editors will post a video top right corner of this video. And also there will be information on how to sign up as an affiliate with me through Clickbank, DigiStore, and other networks in the links in the description. I'd love to work with you. And I'd love for us to make money together. And the bonus is going to be on my JV page, which is my affiliate page. I'm giving away a dozen free emails. A dozen emails, which you can actually use to send to people that work. That help them, that motivate them to take action and join my training program. And you earn money. I earn money. Everybody earns money together. So I'd like to work with you. And I hope you like working with me. And I commit to providing you training every single day. For at the very least the rest of this year to help you learn how to make money with the internet. So make sure you murder that subscribe button. Just hit it really hard. And also hit that notification bell and make sure you enable all notifications. Like this video, if you have questions asking below, I'm not going to answer them. But I encourage people who have been following me for a while. Subscribers to answer other people's questions. Or if you have aren't a subscriber, help answer other people's questions. We're building a community here. We have four different communities, which you can be a part of learning how to make money online. Again, we're all working together. I want to create an ecosystem where we all make money and all learn from each other. We have a Reddit. If you love Reddit, if Reddit's your favorite, go Reddit. We have a Discord chat channel. We have a forum and we have a Facebook group, whichever community group you like the most, say go Discord or go forum or go Facebook group. The point being, I'm trying to create a community here. I want us to work together. I want you selling my product. I want to be paying you money. But I need you to do your work and you need to set this stuff up and you need to check out my free traffic methods playlist, which I'll have my editors link to above as well. And go through the videos. I show you how to get people to that page. Because I showed you how to build an email list, but I didn't show how to get people to it. And those are in my free traffic methods videos. So you want to watch those videos to learn how to get people to go to that link. To learn how to get people to sign up. And once they sign up, you have 12 free emails in which you can send them to help encourage them to take that scary step. It's scary because we've been told our entire lives that we have to commute to work. We have to work out. You know, in America, it's a good job. In India, it's to become an engineer. In the Philippines, it's to become a nurse. In Germany, it's to go into finance. Every culture in Iran, it's to become a lawyer or a doctor. Every culture has their thing that they want their kids to be. But many of these professions are boring, nepotistic, dying, and they make you hate your life. Don't do that. Doesn't make sense. I make millions of dollars every year. Just doing teaching and doing marketing for other companies. And you can too. So help me help you. Take action a day. Subscribe. Like the video and comment below. Looking forward to talking to you soon.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_158.mp3:  Yeah, you know Joe Rogan is like dangerous his stupidity is kind of dangerous Oh, no, I you know, I know a lot of his hardcore fans are gonna be clicking on this and it's just kind of gonna say you But my buddy Joe me Joe fucking us you man. He's better than you. What the fuck? You know, he actually did this I was trying to watch this. I got 54 minutes in this is how far I got in right last night I just had to keep on stopping like oh Jesus. Okay. I get it I have degree in politics and I have to degrees in philosophy So a lot of the concepts are really easy for me, but you know what I know they're easy for a lot of people to understand What double speak is what news speak is to understand the linguistic games being played by the left I mean you start watching this and thank God at least Andy go got to tell like his side of the story pretty much Uninterrupted thank God for the first 10 minutes and then at the end of it you see Joe Wow, this is all really confusing, you know, it's so confusing. It's so no, it's not fucking confusing Joe It's confusing because you're trying to play the false center. It's confusing because you've got this false neutrality It's confusing to you because you're not fucking waking up and realizing that you're being manipulated by the left You don't even understand what fucking double speak is you don't get that that and Tifa are actually pro-fascists When I stopped watching it's when Joe Rogan's you know keeps cutting fucking Andy off Well, can we get a definition of this and what do you mean by that and what do you mean by this like Joe thinks he's doing like the Platonic method or the Socratic method where you ask people questions in order to make them realize that maybe their position is wrong But no, you're not doing it right Joe You're asking people questions because you legitimately don't know what the fuck they're talking about which is so messed up to me Because your buddy Jordan Peterson you've talked to him at length a lot of the things that you need to understand It would how our world works and has been working historically politically Conceptually you should have all that stuff in your head Joe But you don't for some fucking reason is it the weed is it the cryotherapy? I don't know what's doing it to you But at this final point here of 54 minutes in and he says Jamie call up a definition of fascism And it's like I can't watch this anymore, you know, okay Yeah, yeah, Mr. James Posse and with your three degrees. Yeah, you understand all these concepts Fuck off if you don't already have a basic grasp on what fascism means what are you gonna do? Oh Jamie could you call it up? What did they do? They called that fucking Wikipedia? They called up they typed it into Google and they read the first fucking we hit a form of radical right wing authoritarian Ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power force some of this is correct It is fascism is characterized by dictatorial power Forcible suppression of opposition and strong-med Regimentation society of that that's all true, but hey Radical right wing not necessarily that is not a necessary Essential part of the definition of fascism never was for some reason. Thank God Mary and Webster still has the proper definition of Pretty close anyway a political philosophy moving or a Zim such as that of fascista that exalts nation and often race above the individual Oh, but James it's his nation that's intrinsically right wing Is it are you gonna tell me that Chinese communism for example does not exalt nation and Race above the individual are you gonna tell me that so no nationalism and Exalting the nation and being right wing are not intrinsically tied either if that's your only argument to say that fascism is intrinsically right wing That's a pretty fucking weak argument But anyways, anyways see I didn't actually keep watching. I didn't know that they did this I just saw somebody else mentioned it somebody else mentioned it that you know Joe Rogan is spreading around that fucking fake definition of fascism Do I have to tell you this? I'm sure most of you know this that gangs groups of people of leftist academics get together and Edit Wikipedia articles. That's how Wikipedia works anybody can come in through with a little bit of vetting and edit their articles I'm sure most of you know how unreliable Wikipedia is but maybe a lot of you don't and apparently Joe Rogan doesn't fucking get this and his idiot producer Jamie don't get this it's being used as a tool of new speak They're redefining things in order to change the way that people think if you change the way language works Then you change the way people's thoughts work if you change language you change people's thoughts that's something Understood by leftists. That's why so many leftists so-called historians and politicians Loan behold they have the reason linguistics and communications known Chomsky a linguistics professor suddenly becomes a Historian he was never a true historian. He was playing fucking games with ideas and language in order to change People's thinking to be further and further to the left and this process continues and Joe Rogan somehow I don't get you ding thank you for but they mean don't get you ding fucking Joe Rogan It really pisses me off what a useful idiot he is and that he has such outreach 5.7 million people have watched this now So yeah, oh yo yo yo yo he's kind of confusing and what the Joe keep fucking saying also that really drove me nuts in the first 50 minutes 15.5.0 minutes Yeah, it's just a minority of people though. It's just a minority of people It's just the far the far far left of this and they're the only ones that are violent. No you fucking moron Joe Leftist ideology as it is now so-called extreme leftism but which encompasses The majority of the left believes all authority flows from the barrel of a gun. This is something so Mousetong said that Everybody all of their fucking people that they look up to all of the intellectuals like Carl Marx and Mousetong and Lenin all the rest of them Understood or they believed anyways that no true revolution can come about without violence So no, it's not just a leader. Oh, it's just the minority. It's just the minority of them Even people in the comments are saying yo, I live in Portland and Joe Rogan doesn't fucking understand It's not just the minority of them that are condoning violence In general, they see their violence against the right as righteous because it's against the right and that's that and also Don't you understand this concept that some people just want to see the world burn? Don't you understand how fucking lost and sad and pathetic and and mentally Damaged these new generations of millennials are Though they inherit a lot of that from their boomer from their boomer forbearers I'm not sure we're generation X isn't that but they're so angry about the state of affairs And they think that they're so hard done by because they've been taught in university They've been taught even in high school They've been taught even in grade school that they are victims their victims their victims and they want change And they want revolution and the only way we can have a revolution is through violence therefore Yes, we will beat up on this gay Vietnamese man. Yes. Yeah, and then Joe says don't they realize that people are gonna see that and some You know right wingers who gonna start picking up guns. Yeah, they do know that Joe That's why they're doing it. They're doing it because they want to escalate tensions. They want Violence they want a violent conflagration because they believe that that that violence that chaos that Anarchy is the fertile soil in which progress can be had that's how the left thinks Gabbardy Jordan must have told you some of this shit Joe They really could do thing. It's really confusing fucking Joe Rogan man. Fuck me Let me give you all a piece of advice next time you're in a thrift store and you see in old dictionary It's the bigger the better and the older the better buy it buy it and every once in a while check the fucking words and see how they're changing over time But James that's the nature of language language naturally changes depending on people's usages It used to be that the world word literally actually meant poetically But for some people reason a lot of people started using it as if it meant Factually and now people are dead bent on trying to correct people who are actually using it the way that it used to be used But that's okay. I know a lot of you are confused by what I just said. Yeah, literally actually was a figurative way of speaking in the past But anyways, that's just an example But Language is no longer changing in a natural way. It's changing via social engineering Social engineering like these people that go on Wikipedia and change the articles and change the definitions and they Obedmit information just that video I did two days ago, but Jeffrey Epstein It turns out that they went to Bill Clinton's Wikipedia and they removed anything about Jeffrey Epstein There's all this stuff is going on. It's social engineering. That's not true Progress that's not true evolution of language You're being manipulated go to the thrift store and pick up a couple old dictionaries before 1980 preferably and the bigger the better I know I'm the only sort of person that reads dictionaries for fun, but trust me. It's worthwhile It's worth what and the other thing is though Maybe you should read the book 1984 and read the book I mean, I know a lot of you are probably tempted just to watch the movie But if you don't understand the concept of new speak which I have just finished talking about socially engineering Language in order to change the way people think intentionally and lying with an ideology that's new speak That's from 1984 if you haven't read George or was 1984 Andy Ngo brings up double speak the name Antifa itself is perfect example of double speak. It really is the that they really are the exact opposite of what they say they are They're not anti-fascists. They're very much fascists if you understand What they're going for and if you understand what the proper definition is I guess it does get kind of confusing if you're a fucking champ Right I guess it does get kind of confusing read 1984 Don't you know watch the movie after if you want but if you actually actually want to understand the concepts of new speak and double speak and And how you know the ministry of truth is this building where you go to be fucking tortured and you read it You'll see hey, that's what the left is doing no, it's not on both sides like Joe will have you say well both sides are Oh, it's only just a little minority fuck you Joe, you know you so So fast, I'll oh god All right, all right read 1984 pick up a little dictionary and this fucking tool, you know I don't know what to say you know I tried to say something Joe doesn't stand in antifascist intention is to ask late violence They want the right wing quote-unquote to pick up arms. They want things to get a control look at that one like one like Thanks a lot for clicking a watch and check out my patreon and paypal Link in the description below and on the screen right about now I do require one or two dollars and support every month from as many people as possible because a person like me who tells it like it is Has got no hope of gainful regular full-time employment in Canada So thanks a lot for clicking and watching and please please share sharing is so important right now sharing is so important giving the way YouTube is throttling us they're doing their their their part to they're trying to disappear us down the memory hole Please read 1984 all right, we'll talk to you again real soon. Have a nice weekend. Bye bye folks\n",

I couldn't believe it either, but I spent years going through the Florence Thai police records. And this wasn't the saddled story of police persecution. The suits were usually initiated by the Jews themselves. Debt collection was an intensely adversarial process, and the usual method was to force a settlement by having the Christian default or arrested in jailed. And on rare occasions Jews had Jewish debtors imprisoned as well, not nice. Not caution, right? There's a matter of fact.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_428.mp3:  Oh useless eaters. It's your unqualified, not elected global human health overlord. I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and your future. When I am asked my fortune in computer software, I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monocleistic control to destroy my competitors. Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian. With my full profit foundation mass grading as a charity, I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations. Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die. Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and calling the human herd for fun and profit. In November of last year, I hosted event 201, a war game simulation of a global pandemic. Leaders from private corporations, global banks, governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could align in lockstep when responding to worldwide health crisis. Using a coordinated campaign of fear-mongering, intimidation, social shaming, and economic blackmail, we realized that we could get around dangerous philosophies like individual liberty and national sovereignty. With an obedient population, we would be free to implement our own top-down solutions, like forced quarantines, social distancing, contact tracing, and mandatory testing, as it means to seize technocratic control of society. Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release our own global pandemic. It was my chance to look like the most redomest of public health, and to position myself and business partners like Dr. Fauci as the de facto authorities on response and solutions. Through exaggerated doom-stay scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control freaks instituted harsh rules and draconian lockdowns. And after our dire predictions proved fast, stared and well-meaning people continued to submit to the arbitrary and foolish demands of their so-called leaders. Having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law, we'll continue to hold hostage your ability to congregate, work, travel, or do just about anything until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan. I'd like to call this pandemic one, because believe me, we have others in the works. Our final solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate, tag, and digitally track each one of you, like livestock, not only will my foundation enjoy legal immunity and trillions in profits, but these mandatory, experimental vaccines will move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global control. If only like good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with me aboard the Lolita Express. So remember, global citizens, this will end when I say it ends. Could be a year, maybe two years, maybe never. I guarantee that if we have our way, it will be at least until you're not able to do anything to stop it. Just surrender your personal freedom and condense to our fear merchants and government and the media, because none of this works unless you all go along with it. Now feel excuse me, I'm off to do some augmented reality spirit cooking with Marino Brahmavic. Bye now!\n",

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation revealed in a statement that Phil, who had been in inmate at the California Healthcare Facility, in Stockton, California since 2013, had passed away from natural causes. While it is currently unknown what caused Phil's death, the CDCR noted that its official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office. In statement, the CDCR also included an updated mug shot of Phil that was taken last November. Phil, who often wore wigs before his conviction, is seen bald and smiling in the recent mug shot. Back in 2009, Phil was found guilty of second-degree murder for the death of actress Lana Clarkson. This conviction happened in a second trial after the first one was deadlocked in 2007. Phil ended up being sentenced to 19 years to life in prison and was eligible for parole hearing in 2025. Phil, who was born Harvey Phillips Spector in 1939, is known for revolutionizing rock and pot music in the 1960s with his layered wall of sound production technique. During his career, Phil has produced music for legendary bands and artists such as The Beatles, The Remones, and even Cher.\n",

I'm a poor person. I'm a poor member of DSA. Our chapter is a majority poor chapter. I make no money. But I give everything to DSA. I give 100,000% of my labor to DSA. Members who are poor give 100% of their labor to DSA. We love this organization. This Constitution bylaws change would simply redefine how we approach members. We would no longer refer to members as do's paying members. Some of us can't afford that. But we still give our all to DSA. It would also redefine as a member in good standing. Because no matter what we pay or if we can pay, we're still members in good standing. I think maybe some of you have heard me extoll the virtue of poor people's movements. If you read chapter five, there's an entire story about the National Welfare Rights Organization and the problems that were caused by their due system. They didn't require dues. Some chapters did. It eventually fell apart. I'd like to read just one small paragraph from that. In organizing doctrine, membership means something more than merely formal affiliation through the payment of dues. It also means active participation in the life of the organization in demonstrations, for example. Mass participation is ostensibly the functional equivalent of political resources such as wealth, which interest groups elsewhere in the social structure possess. As organizers sometimes put it, poor people have numbers. Membership, in short, means regular participation by masses of people. Please support this Constitution by last change.\n",

We're finding out today that he has been denied bail. He's going to be forced to stay in this tiny cell until his hearing. And they're saying that they're preparing here for a dump of information. They're saying that this massive document dump is going to be imminent in that the associates of this man should prepare for the worst. Some people that have been caught going to his places have been trying to deny any association with him. Trying to say, yeah, why I know him may have went there just to say hi or hang out once or twice was invited, but nothing, you know, bad went down. But that's what many say when other things have happened behind the curtain. And this is why he is finally getting taken down a lot of people are nervous because they feel that this is ultimately going to lead to a lot of names being dropped. Now let me remind everybody if you don't recall, this is a big one. Don't forget this. Bill Clinton's name keeps getting brought up, right? But you have got to remember that the judge overseeing this whole thing was appointed by Bill Clinton. Don't forget that. It's pretty key in this whole thing. So go back to a costa that just said he was stepping down a costa was supposed to prosecute Epstein and gave him a very lenient sentence last time. And when they asked him, well, why did you do this? His answer was that he belonged to intelligence. That's what he was told. He was reportedly told that Epstein belonged to intelligence. That is interesting as well.

It wasn't that violence wasn't necessary. It was that we couldn't win with violence. We couldn't get our agenda accomplished with violence. America is showing us something totally different right now. It is saying we will not pay you any attention until you burn something down. And that's not our fault. If it was up to me, Glenn, if it was up to me, I would be somewhere writing a book right now. Exipping them a most doing all the cosmopolitan things that we have all been accustomed to and programmed to desire and want. But America is signaling to us that we will not give you any attention. We will not pay any attention to your grievances unless you are burning something down. So the strategy inherently has to change. And then even still, I want to correct myself a little more. It wasn't until they saw the violence of bloody Sunday that mean, well, meaning liberals were actually kicked into gear to say, okay, we have to do something. So it really is a condemnation of the United States of America that in order for us to have any type of meaningful change, violence has to be attached to it.

And somebody murdered her and took the baby, basically kidnapped the baby, out of her eulirus. Now, this happened before, by the way. It was a case in Chicago where your head was living in the projects. She was probably the only white woman living in this amongst the savages. And she had this black boyfriend became impregnated. She had two white children. And the relatives of the black boyfriend murdered this white woman when she was pregnant, took the baby out and then murdered the two white children, murdered her and murdered the two white children. Now, they were supposed to get the death penalty, but apparently it was commuted to life sentences, which is, you know, they were like a whole bunch of them. They were all black criminals, you know. I mean, the blacks are so vicious, so sadistic. So now in this case, they don't give the identity of the perpetrator, okay, who killed this white girl for her eulirus. And of course, you know, knowing the fake media, when they don't give the name of the identity, certain of the race of the perpetrator, you know, they're the black or their spikes or their white bags from Mexico, most likely black, but we will see. I have a article below, but it just gives you an idea of what we're dealing with or we're dealing with savages. I mean, just when you think they have committed the worst possible crime that anybody could commit, here they come again. And they will outdo themselves. I mean, this is the level of criminality of this subhuman population, just beyond, beyond any description. I mean, you know, I want to say animals, but even animals are, I mean, if you ever seen animals in the forest, how they have compassion for their own, how the elephants go to the graveyard and literally weep over their dead relatives.

You should have worked towards becoming Prime Minister of Israel one day. I don't know if I can have like an ultiright Prime Minister of Israel one day. With this rhetoric, I don't know if I could. They discovered this interview one day in all my publications. With the exception of maybe Iran and the Russian aid to put to Assad, we are the regional hegemon in terms of military. We're a very small country. We could flatten half the Middle East in an offensive onslaught tomorrow. I'm doing this. No, that's not a smart thing to do. Not necessarily. But also, people talk about we're genociding the Palestinians. I think we've shown immense restraint. We could genocide in tomorrow. We could go in and flatten the Gaza tomorrow with our fighter jets. But we don't do it. It's obviously immoral. I don't believe in genocide. But I do believe in expulsion because I think it would be better for everyone involved. Nationalism, this is why we need our separate countries.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_84.mp3:  Senator, you called the alleged attack on Jesse Smollett a modern day lynching when it happened. Now police sources are telling many networks that Mr. Smollett is under potential investigation for, you know, concocting a story on paying these men. Is it time to revisit what you said about these remarks? What is your feeling on potential? Hope to hate crimes in general? Well, the information is still coming out. I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources. We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way. We actually even know in this country that since 9-11, the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks. The majority of them, white supremacist attacks from the horrific shootings in Pittsburgh or in South Carolina church. What we're seeing is attacks on people because they're different and we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and the bigotry that comes. But what's the concern Mr. Smollett to address this more publicly though? Again, I'm following this in the news as you are and we'll see what happens. But what an arrest of, you know, a hoax attack. Wouldn't that be a detriment to the work that you're trying to do with your anti-glinching bill? Wouldn't that hurt the movements in the middle? We have seen painful realities surge in our country, rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks. We're seeing just vicious or horrific cruel violence that's motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all Americans are in the police restaurant. Have you spoken with Mr. Smollett? No. Senator, I want to ask you about Amazon because you held\n",

And when you're trying to organize poor people asking them to spend their last $5 on personal fundraising is not an option. And I know because some months the last $5 of my paychecks go to national directly. So we've had Confederates and white nationalists show up to our reading groups, not meetings, reading groups with guns and threaten our lives because we're forced to choose public meeting spaces due to financial restraints. And pass the hat would make sure that no other small chapter has to deal with that. No other small chapter has to spend their last $3 when they live paychecks today on paychecks. Like just trying to get like resources. We're not like asking that we don't have to pay dues. We're asking that we have support from an organization that we get everything to. We risk our lives for national and pass the hat would ensure that we are somewhat supported in that. Thank you.\n",

Imagine if a white man was to make a movie about the very real ritual genital mutilation of the Jewish community or to take some creative liberties in portraying Jewish ritual murder. There would be endless coveging bannings, possibly some untimely deaths, and media loudly proclaiming that such hatred is actually incitement to violence. However, when you have a Jew-leg gariaster who directed hereditary, now releasing a film to paint Europeans who embrace their pre-Judeo-Christian ways in the worst possible light. It is just incredible artistic expression. Ariaster is a Jew who obviously hates white people in our culture. Hold some things like flower crowns, runes, white people dressed in white and celebrating the turning of the seasons are seen as being insanely evil. Honestly, this Jew is just doing what Judeo-Christians have done for centuries, now with a new medium with which to terrify people into embracing the Torah. Just take a look at the trailer for this film and you will see what I am talking about. Christian says that you've got some special day planned. Yeah, it's like a craze in 9-day festival. It only happens every 9 years. Hi. Hello, thank you for the work. You can't speak. You speak? You can't speak? You can't move? But this opens your up to the influence.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_606.mp3:  In my adopted religious tradition of Judaism, people have responsibility, have agency after the age of 13. So 13-year-old girls, 13-year-old boys are regarded in Judaism as being responsible for their actions. So if I take Torah seriously, I have to regard all the goals that I've read about in the Jeffrey Epstein stories that I've read in the Miami Herald as having agency as being responsible for their choices. I have not read anything about Jeffrey Epstein and his procurers forcing people at gunpoint to perform sexual acts. All I've ever seen is grooming and the paying of money and the giving of gifts to entice girls who generally seem as far as I remember to be over to be 13 years of age or older to be performing sexual favors for money. So just thinking out loud to me, they are responsible for their choices. They were over the age of 13, they took money to do these deeds. That doesn't let Jeffrey Epstein off the hook just as if I facilitate some kind of illicit or immoral arrangement with elsewhere. I still bear some responsibility, but I certainly don't view a 13-year-old girl who takes money for performing sex acts as having no agency. I'm just curious what the rest of the panel believed. Do you think that a 13, 14, 15, 16-year-old girl who takes money for performing sex acts bears no responsibility? Does she have no moral agency? Look, their age of consent loss in the United States. Furthermore, the interstate transportation, that is the transportation of a woman under a certain age across state lines, whether by vehicle or airplane for the purpose of prostitution is a felony. We do not believe that children, 14-year-old is still a child, is not capable of giving informed consent. That's why it's against the law to have sexual relations with a 13 or 14-year-old. Well, it depends on the locale. So age of consent is due very. Also, there's no necessary connection between locality and morality. I was speaking morality. I was not speaking legality. So in some states, sex with a 14-year-old is permitted. In other states, the person has to be 18. The morality doesn't change. Only the locality changes. Throughout Western history has been quite common for 13, 14, 15, 16-year-olds to get married. So anyone else want to weigh in on this topic? Look, that's a special argument for the reason that children are protected in the way that they were not protected in the past. It was not unusual in the past for six, 16-year-old girls to be married off and then to work as farmers' wives for the rest of their lives. That's not the way it works now. And as a matter of there is no age consent in the in 50 states of the United States below the age of 16. Brondel, if your teacher had given you a bludger when you were 14, would your female teacher would you have regarded yourself as irreparably damaged and completely lacking in agency? Will Durant, the philosopher, by the way, fell in love with his wife when she was 14. So they were together since she was age 14. Also, the leader of France, Emmanuel Macron, fell in love with his teacher when he was 14, 15 years of age and what a wonderful relationship that has turned out to be. You threatened those children, didn't you? That's not the way it happened. You told them to lie, to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them. These things did happen. Because if they didn't go along, you were going to tell everyone about this special party. They happened to me. So you made up a story, a special story, a story about a math teacher who was tough on you, who kept you after class, a huge hog beast, you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it? No, I didn't want to be the only one.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_404.mp3:  Just as lead dark issue number one from DC Comics, I know this is late, but I literally just got this issue this Wednesday. I wanted to do a review on it when it came out, but the copies at my local comic book store got damaged and the new shipment literally did not come in until this past Wednesday. So, yeah, I was debating on whether I should review this or not. I mean, I really liked this stuff like that, but I have other comics I was thinking of doing since they got released this week as well. Also, I can maybe be at a, uh, Fathom number two, spawn, uh, Witchblade or maybe Detective Comics. Um, I'm not doing them now because I haven't had a chance to, to reading any of them yet. Um, I'll probably do one of these on Monday. I'm kind of leaning towards Fathom just because it's been a last since I've reviewed that one. I literally reviewed the last issue of Detective Comics just a while ago. Why don't you guys decide, um, which one of these three you want me to review? I was thinking of doing, um, Red Hood and the Outlaws because I've heard that, you know, the latest issue is like a lot of crazy things went down, but... Uh, again, the issues didn't get destroyed. Uh, instead for some reason, the, um, comics got delivered to the wrong store. So, my local comic book store got, you know, some comics from another place and the other place got comics from my local comic store. Yeah, it's, I, I don't know what the hell's going on. I don't blame my local comic books or at all. Um, I blame the delivery, but it seems like there's always an issue, especially with one of the series that I want to read. Either the comics are destroyed upon delivery or they get shipped to another store, so we have to wait another week or two. But, uh, yeah, surprisingly even Domino got, uh, got shipped to the wrong place. So I can't review Domino either. Uh, so we're gonna do Justice League Dark and then when I get the chance to read one of those, uh, on three issues, we're doing those on Monday. So, um, isn't it kind of funny how, uh, like the DC animated movies are so freaking good. And then though I've actions just really terrible, I don't know why they don't just get the same people who like wrote and direct the animated series to go... to one of the live actions. I've been old, probably turned out pretty good. Um, I know obviously there's a difference between directing a cartoon and directing the live action, but I don't know. I feel like this is, uh, X-Nighter is like the wrong person to kind of help up the DC universe. And, uh, the less said about Josh Sweden and the better. Um, but yeah, so we start off with, uh, Zetana or Zetana. Um, doing a magic trick and it going wrong. Actually, it's gonna do the classic pull of the bunny of the hat and the bunny comes out dead. And then a giant almost cthul-like beast. When I say cthul-lo, actually I should say cthul- I should say live crafty and like beast. Uh, your rubs from her hat and starts attacking the audience. Um, and then one of woman comes for the save. Here's the thing. Um, I'm not like against Wonder Woman being in this, but basically the new just a league dark team is kind of helmed by her. I don't know if she's gonna end up being the leader or if she's just kind of pulling a Batman where she's gathering the team together and then she's gonna kind of step aside and then say Tana lead. But, um, I'm not the biggest fan of Wonder Woman leading the magic team. I get it. It's like, you know, she comes from O'Anne that has magic. She uses magical items. But I just, I really don't associate her with magic. Not to mention the fact that she already has a team just as league. So I just, I hate when like other, like, I hate when it's hot three gets shoehorned into everything. I'm not saying she's shoehorned into this, but give, you know, Constantine the, the helm again. I mean, his whole thing is supernatural and magic. Um, I mean, she already has her team and I just, I don't know. I just don't want, I just don't really want her to helm this team as well. It's just, I just, I just don't know. I don't like it when Superman, Batman or Wonder Woman are going around like leading a bunch of teams. Um, then again, I don't, I don't really like when Superheroes in general are spread across so many different series like when they're kind of contained to their own thing. But, uh, yeah, we get, we get a fight scene between, uh, between Wonder Woman and Zitana against the, uh, the creature. So, uh, yeah, Zitana, here's like our, our only thing with Constantine. He kind of just shows up and he's, he's asking her if, uh, if she's gone like any news and clues and stuff like that on the magic. Basically, uh, I like this idea for a surround. Basically, magic is turning against this users and that that's, I don't know, to me, that's like a really cool idea. Um, and it's, with everybody, everybody who's trying to use magic for some reason, like the spells and things with that are going against them. Um, one of the things that, it was, uh, Constantine, uh, killed Zitana's father by burning him alive with one of the spells for she, he didn't do it on purpose. But yeah, I like that whole story idea. It's really cool. Uh, we get a little bit more where, uh, the, uh, Wonder Woman is talking to Detective Chimp and the, I forgot what the name of the bar was. Yeah, is it say the Oblivion bar? The Oblivion bar that we saw in DC Comics. Um, the reason why I moved the camera was just because I don't want to show all the pages. But, uh, yeah, basically she's talking to Detective Chimp who I'm a fan of. The Dark Knight's medal made me a fan of Detective Chimp. But I mean, come on, he's a, he's a monkey that solves crime. Like that's awesome. Um, yeah, we get, we get some pretty cool horrifying scenes where basically, yeah, magic is just like, turning against people. And, uh, this is like lovecraftian stuff right here. Um, but yeah, uh, basically the whole stick of, uh, this issue is that magic is turning against his users. So Wonder Woman, um, goes to a bar, drinks with a monkey that solves crime and they decide to put a team together. Oh, that premise. Um, so yeah, we get like some of the other supernatural characters, uh, who deal out with magic, getting together and kind of talking about how, um, the events of the Dark Knight's medal, the breaking of the, uh, the wall has, uh, somehow leaked in some presence that is affecting their magic. And they gotta, uh, they gotta do something to, uh, to fix this, um, and the Azutana is there and she notices that swamp thing is spying on them. Oh, this action comics, action comics, Alex, anyone see the, the superman? Well, he's superman issue where, where Batman announces to the Justice League that he has diarrhea and he needs to pull out of the Batmobile so he can take a shit because that literally happened. No joke that this isn't me like trying to fool you guys at that literally happened. And, uh, uh, and they also had, um, with Wally's hairstyle and color, like they made Barry Redhead. I think that was just a colorist mistake. Basically, there's no editors, uh, when it comes to Bendis. And, uh, yeah, a lot of people were giving Bendis a chance and I felt I was one of the only people who like, I didn't even want to give him any, like not even a sliver of a chance. Some people were like, oh, you know, he might do bad, but maybe, maybe he might do good. And I'm like, nah, he's gonna, he's gonna fuck it up and he did. He fucked up Superman. Um, also because of him, we now get a bunch of, uh, we got, uh, what Wonder Woman being ruined. Awkman Bands gonna be ruined. Yeah, see, I mean, when you bring in Bendis, you don't just bring in Bendis. You bring in all Bendis' friends. So yeah, it was nice knowing you DC, but, uh, your Batman sucks. Your Superman sucks, your Wonder Woman is gonna suck. Even though she hasn't been kind of sucking lately, uh, your Aquaman is gonna suck. Um, I mean, stay away from my Green Lanterns. Um, so far, I think the Green Lanterns are gonna be, gonna be okay. I think we got, uh, Grant Morrison from the five remember this correctly. He's gonna be doing how Jordan and then we got, uh, Jurgens, who's doing Green Lanterns. He's been doing an amazing job on that. Um, but yeah, stay away from them, uh, Red Hood Nialaw. Um, from what I've understood, um, I don't know if I'm gonna be liking the direction, it's gonna be going, but we'll see. I don't want to judge without reading the issue, but, uh, yeah, basically the, the, the arrival of Bendis is kind of taking the scene in a very bad direction. So, um, yeah, we get, uh, we, we go to the Justice League Dark Fortress, um, where we have Manbat, who is, um, doing good. I guess he's, he's working with Wonder Woman now, and we get more of the horrifying results of people using magic. Yeah. I'm gonna end this here because I don't want to show the rest, because I, I think you guys should read this issue. I don't want to spoil anything, but I just don't want to show all the, all the pages for copyright reasons. But, uh, this is a, a great issue. I really liked it. Again, my, my one nitpick is, um, and this, this is, this is completely my opinion, people couldn't, you know, completely disagree with me. I'm just, I don't like Wonder Woman. I don't find, I don't think she should, she should be, um, a part of the Justice League Dark. Even though she uses magic and stuff like that, it's not really her, she's not known for her magic. So, um, yeah, ignore my dogs. So yeah, pick it up. Good issue. Um, hope you guys enjoyed. Uh, I have, uh, I'm not gonna, you know what, I'm not gonna plug all that stuff. I'm just gonna say, uh, if you guys like this, please hit the, uh, subscribe button if you haven't already hit the bell for notification, leave a like, comments, share this with your friends and family.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_376.mp3:  So this is going to be the story of Tracy Hunter, a juvenile judge in Ohio who was just sentenced to six months basically for nepotism. Alright she abused her palace. She was indicted on eight counts back in 2014. She was sentenced in 2014. She appealed the decision right and after she appealed the decision in 2014 she stood there and it went the whole way to the Supreme Court and they gave a state of, as almost like a state of execution they stood there and said you know we're not gonna sit there and lock you up at the moment we're gonna let you run your appeal out which is honestly kind of insane right like usually that does not happen okay she was accused of back dating documents and trying to prevent prosecutors from repealing her decisions against them and then properly used her positions as a judge to give confidential documents to a brother a juvenile court employee who was in the process of getting fired now how was he why was he getting fired because he had punished a child who was in his care. This is Ohio, yo, I'm be honest with you Ohio is a fucked up place the kid may have been completely the fuck out of line alright I'll be honest with you but you know in this modern day and age you can't sit there and you know actually you know hit somebody right so in octaves she was indicted in January 2014 eight counts in October a jury convicted a hunter of a single count related to giving the convention a confidential documents to a brother after he testified in court that she gave him the documents of the Hamilton County juvenile jail last year he was fired from his job for punching a juvenile inmate according to prosecution witnesses judge hunter requested documents including medical information of that inmate involved in the incident well the supervisors who run the jail testified those who are unusual requests and thought it was a conflict of interest well today Stephen Hunter told the prosecutor his sister gave him the case file just one day before his disciplinary hearing I got every every see them I took them from death hunter to look at the file yes yes she was actually convicted of these crimes right and they gave her a sentence of six months and a year's worth of probation alright she stood here and filed for an appeal okay the Ohio Supreme Court allowed her to remain out of jail while she pursued her her appeals and then she tried to have the judge Patrick dick a dick and lacquer dick lacquer mink lacquer removed from the case so Ohio Supreme Court justice marino Connor denied this right now after that in September 2015 her lawyer says he can no longer represent her and he says he can no longer represent her because it's a conflict of interest because he also represented the judge in a drink and driving case or something like that oh it was a fatal crash where two vehicles had struck a woman and this is Ohio you know what I'm saying right now in January 2016 the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld her sentence okay so in May of 2016 the US district attorney Tim Black emergency issued an emergency stay of her sentence and tells a hunter's attorneys that had filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that she didn't get a fair trial because the mistake spotted judge and misconduct about a special prosecutor's hand of the case at a court hearing you dink lacquer says calls to stay an overreach by a federal judge the federal magistrate recommends denying hunter's challenger conviction black must make the final decision two years after the maddened days recommendation black and a 26-page decision says hunter sentence can be imposed he says strong evidence against hunter undermine her claims of the verticals of inflammatory and prejudicial effect that remarks made by a special prosecutor during closing arguments now so and then Monday July 22nd 2019 they actually had the sentencing hearing all right once they finally got to the sentencing hearing they stood here and they said you would get a years worth of probation all right and six months in jail and I'm going to show you some footage of that right now and I just is thrown around a lot just to manage in this particular case so the court this hunter or the execution is sent some pros on December 50 2014 by Judge Nadel that is as follows one year community control that's non-reporting since you will be on community control I will buy you as I'm required to buy law and if you violate any of the conditions of the post of the community control come back in front of me I will send you to 18 months you'll have a heart of correction it is the felony of the fourth degree the conditions the community control control are real simple is indicated in judgment entry by Judge Nadel number one you pay the cost of these proceedings number two you are just do not violate any laws number three you are the six months in the Hamilton County Justice Center credit one day Mr. Miss Deputy can take your way so why did this happen why was there a full champ out after a fucking decision to send her to the county for six months first off she's going to a female facility alright and like I want everybody to understand like a female facility is I don't even know like how to explain what a female facility is like it's it's like basically just going to like I don't even know how like it's it's like the most basic as fuck it just a place you go hang the fuck out for six months all right it's like a female facility is not anything like a male facility in any way shape or form like you go to the county as a man it's gonna suck a lot alright because like legitimately you know it is what it is right but going to the county as a female is a whole different animal like it it's pretty fucking basic you know just go and fucking do your time read sleep whatever and I mean nobody got down bothers you you know might pick up a lesbian level why you there whatever and I mean fucking but yeah it's usually just out of your choice it's not the fact that somebody makes you that bitch right it's like it's a it's a whole different animal and the county like usually the gay shit don't don't really happen as often unless you're in like a jungle I mean which I've meant to the jungle before just you go on a state you know I mean which case you know I'm saying like I want now you might have to protect the booty hole I mean you know me sleep on your back it is what it is but on top of that they stood here and turned her into this symbol of black women you know I mean who are strong and don't need no man bull shit I'm a Paul I believe as a travesty and my question is where's the kitchen sink everything's been thrown except the kitchen sink and this has been an assault against this judge since 2010 when everything possible was done spent almost two million dollars of taxpayer money trying to stop this judge from being seated when that didn't work the attacks continue and hey one thing I know is the truth is what makes one free it's right because like fucking they stood here and they spent all this money to get this broad guy damn elected in a pretty black district and she came in with the mentality of you know fucking all these white men and races and they've been abused in the system forever which I'm not gonna lie like most judges do abuse the fucking system and I mean like it is what it is like it's rare that you run across a real straight-ass straight arrow fucking judge like the vast majority of you want them to be fucking lenient and I mean you want to have a chance to not be a by the book motherfucker you know like you you don't want a judge who goes directly by the book all the time because you're gonna end up getting a book thrown at you like that's just how that shit operates so you know you kind of do want that and the problem is is that like she thinks that like all of them completely corrupt pieces of shit and she assumed that she could just go in there and be a completely corrupt piece of shit didn't even wait for a time in then learn nothing you know what I'm saying you could tell that she's batshit as fucking crazy just by the look on the motherfucker face her being dragged out of the courtroom with the fireman's carry that was fucking hilarious you know I mean that dead weight dead weight dead weight like arms like man listen you know I mean you know and that fat bitch was also arrested who jumped over the motherfucker and jumped over the joint and went to went towards the motherfuckin bench to fight the bailiff and shit she was also locked up for contempt of court and assault and an officer and I mean which she should be and she'll probably get longer than the judge did because she doesn't have the judges fucking resources and I mean nobody gives a fuck about her and she doesn't have a name let's see this is why it's so hard to prosecute fucking politicians and individuals who are corrupt because they're able to hide behind this bullshit of I'm a black female I'm a white female you know I mean I'm a fucking elderly individual you know I fucking come from I'm a native American whatever the case might be right and then you know you have to fight their whole group to get them to fuck go to goddamn jail you know and you piss everybody off when you fucking lock them up reality is she's a corrupt piece of shit you know what I'm saying like legitimately like yo if it was your kid that that dude hit in on the mean and like the kid hadn't done anything to normalize that which I don't fucking believe to be honest with you you know I mean but the fact that if a judge stood here and ruled against you in that favor like say you were up for something and the judge stood here and fucked you by giving you know I mean the DA some shit that they weren't allowed the fucking half you'd feel some sort of kind of way about it you know and this is really where the fuck it's at this is really the mentality where all this gets down to like yo look you can't be having individuals out here just abusing them on the fucking power and getting their family members to fuck off a criminal charges oh really nearly whenever the fuck they want to that's that's not how fucking democracy works that's not how our justice system works that's not how shit set the fuck up and I understand that like black people think there's been a lot of racial inequality like the reality it's not and I mean it's not the situation it's feminism and garbage and bullshit and females rights which have really fucked the black community because if you have a conversation with an older black dude who's like 50-60 years old and you talk to him about being back in the 70s and they'll tell you their whole their family own blocks of land you know what I'm saying and fucking like yo they have they had massive amounts of rental properties and shit they were on a come-up and then all of a sudden all this bullshit came through with the female rights and the corporatism and all the nonsense and all of it went down to fucking toilet and the same thing happened to most of the white community and you know we were talking about a movie last night falling down which you know like it's it's all around the board but white people aren't allowed to bitch because like oh man well white men got all the wrong fucking privilege out of this I'm like oh but one percent of the white men did right like out of you know I mean the 200 million 220 million 230 million 250 260 million white men and this white people in this fucking country and I mean it was like one percent of those motherfuckers got all the privilege like what 26 thousand of us you know I mean and the rest of us all got fucked you know I mean like legit and that's really where it's at the rest of us all lost money we all lost wages ended up in debt and fucked up and losing all families in a whole bullshit in our society being in our culture and everything being crushed and destroyed that's the reality and I mean like yo and we have to have this conversation publicly you know I mean have this more fucking shit and I'm not even anti like you know if one percent gain in the money it's just something has to give something has to fucking change so that the middle class and the lower middle class working poor and I mean can have an opportunity to be upperly mobile because right now they're down where the mobile just as a state of opinion the state of facts you know I mean it is what it is you can go oh man you know you hear Ben Shapiro and fucking cup of art people don't like you know fucking this is the one country in the world where if you're born poor it's a good chance you're not gonna die poor you know and that's not the truth anymore like you're taking a measurement from fucking 50 years ago blinding today and it's just not true it is what it is in the meantime man yo this is Tom P's of P-Noir News figured y'all enjoy the more fucking video hot let's your fucking boy peace\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_363.mp3:  You shouldn't trust anything you sense anymore. No, that's not a misstatement because we're going to be talking about the latest technological advancements of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and of course the topic of deep fakes, which me and Jason have been talking about for a very long time, but we're getting yet another glimpse into it as a new startup company used Joe Rogan's podcast to create a voice duplicate, which people are saying sounds startlingly accurate. We're going to play a little bit of that clip, but this is interesting, Jason. There's a lot to talk about here. I have some personal experiences with people in my life having deep fakes used against them, but this is something that's not going to go away is going to be a major problem, and I believe only going to get worse from here. Yeah, and this audio isn't really, I mean this audio is new, but the audio technology not really. In fact, Adobe has demoed this now for over a year, and I use Adobe tools all the time. And basically, the more it's able to ingest the better accuracy you're going to get of fake audio, I would say, when we listen to this, it's good. It's not great. At the same time, if it was a small snippet or it was added with some background noise or another person, I think it would become more and more legitimate. You know, there are a few small breaks in here, but overall, it is stunningly accurate. Yeah, I mean, if we had this clip played to us, normally without any context, I would be like, yeah, whatever, that's the Joe Rogan podcast. We listened to that. And again, this is from a startup. All right, so this is a company going public with this. You can only imagine we're going to get into all that later. We're going to get into running man. We're going to get into all that. But this is by company called Dasa. It's an AI company, artificial intelligence company staffed by former employees at Google, IBM and Microsoft. All major corporations with ties to the government. So you can only imagine what the government is doing. But let's play like 30 seconds of this latest clip. I thought it was funny. At least the people at Dasa have a little bit of a sense of humor here. Friends, I've got something new to tell all of you. I've decided the sponsor hockey team made up entirely of chimps. And tired of people telling me that chimps are not capable of kicking human ass and sports. Chimps are just superior athletes. And these chimps have been working out hard. The throwing kettlebells, battle ropes, everything. I've got them on a strict diet of bone broth and elk meat. He's just stopping right there. You can see how it's broken up a little bit. It doesn't quite flow like a human conversation. But obviously they've also chosen some pretty ridiculous subject matter to kind of push their point forward that, hey, we're going to be able to make people say whatever we want them to. And it's going to sound almost exactly if not exactly like them. Yeah. Later, you know, it's a whole audio clip. He's obviously not an indoor thing. A chimpanzee, hockey team. I thought that was pretty funny. Then he goes off later, videos often and talks about some tongue twisters and then talks about how everything could be a simulation and how this could be a simulation because of the artificial intelligence deepfakes that shows us how we could just simulate our own voices and videos. So why, if technology is becoming so advanced where we could simulate other kind of video, audio, life forms, why can't we simulate everything which sparks a whole another debate that could be engaged here. But Jason, this is technological advancements that are progressing, are getting bigger. This is why it's important to talk about this. This is not old news. This is news that's developing. And soon, all of this information, all of this technology is going to be let out of the cage for anyone and everyone to use. And there's going to be a lot of effects of that. And what I really would consider here is if this is a startup going public with this, what's private at the Central Intelligence Agency, what technological advancements do they have that we don't even know about that could be used for sinister purposes like expoused during the fictional movie, Running Man, that you were just talking about before we get on this program. And the possibility here are stunning when you actually look at the bigger moves made by the CIA, the actual actions committed by them. And now imagine this technology empowered by them, holy cow, it literally plays out of scenes from Running Man that you described before. Yeah, you know, Running Man for those that don't remember, this is a movie that was based on a Stephen King novel all the way back when Stephen King was going by Richard Bachman, he was not the Stephen King we know today. He had a bunch of books under a pen name and it begins with Schwarzenegger being an a helicopter and being ordered to basically kill civilians when they were out there for a food drop. Now he doesn't want to do it. You know, he gets into a fight with a couple of the other officers. However, when they release video, now this isn't even the real time stuff that gets in later when they release video, all the sudden Schwarzenegger is the bad guy that wants to kill civilians and they send him to prison. Now he ends up breaking out of prison afterwards, but remember they use this initial deep fake against him. You can see something like that now with Jordan Peel making a fake news PSA about Obama. So that's a pre-made deep fake. Later in the movie, which I think is absolutely incredible. First of all, great satire on reality TV culture, bloodthirstyness. You know, supposedly if you get out of there, Luke, you go to a nice island and you get a million dollars. And hurrah the Rivera plays one of the people that actually you see on the island waving. Later you find out he didn't make it also a deep fake. Jesse Ventura happens to be one of these gladiator types that's at it. He's in retirement. He's the greatest. He's killed all these criminals. He's in the executive room. So at one point, Schwarzenegger gets away, but they've got to propagate that they're number one. They can't let people know that they don't know where this guy is, right? So they bring Jesse Ventura out into a cage battle and they broadcast him fighting with Schwarzenegger, murdering Schwarzenegger by throwing him through spikes. And then as it goes off air, you realize it was all a deep fake as the computer graphics come off the television screen and he just killed somebody else. It was not Schwarzenegger and it was a real-time fake. So you know, this stuff has been espoused now, Luke, for 30, 40 years in movie science fiction to a stark detail. And when you look at real-time fakes, because you know, the one with Obama was not, you could look at face to face and they've done a lot of these demos where they use figures like Daniel Craig, Vladimir Putin or George Bush and side to side use a camera again to grab their facial recognition and do a deep fake. Yeah, I mean, if you're a millennial or if you've never seen Running Man, go see Running Man, excellent film. Definitely let's you think about a lot of the things that are happening in our current modern day society, but they could match to because obviously when we're talking about the deep fake with Obama, Jordan Peale had to do the voiceover. Now this learning technology could advance, they talk about this in this article, they could advance so quickly that they could actually take your voice when the matter of 10 seconds and be able to do this. This is what the next level that they're talking about being implemented here and they're talking about, yeah, this is great for voice assistance. This is great for improving accuracy with speech to text devices and I'm like, look at the trade-off we're making here. No, I don't care, I don't want better voice assistance, I don't want better speech to text, you know, technocratic robotic devices listening to us all the time, I don't want any of that. This is the guys of what they're working with this technology for, but ultimately if you don't think this is going to be weaponized or already is weaponized, you're fooling yourself and they're talking about this technology going on the market being available to the average person within a few years or even sooner and some of the experts on this topic talking about this. And again, when you match in the kind of Jordan Peale audio, because Jordan Peale had to fake in the audio with the fake Obama video, you're going to mix in this technology where again, real-time lifelike, just like we saw in running man fake videos as they are happening, which wouldn't surprise me because we cover a lot of the bigger geopolitical stories. We did warn about how the investigation to the chemical weapons attack in Syria, a lot of the information was hidden, a lot of the information was faked, a lot of the bigger truths about that were suppressed. And again, imagine what you could do to push a war or promote something extremely negative to society with this capability, which again, our government, our quote intelligence agencies have been caught doing time and time again. And again, this is going to hit us sooner than we realize. Technological advancements usually have an up curve that far surpasses our human capabilities. And I was even affected by this. Girl, I was dating once. She had a deep fake personality, of course, but she had deep fake pornographic video made of her. And again, it's like, what the hell? What kind of world are we living in? Where people are literally making fake pornographic videos with individuals that they lust after. And of course, pornographic websites have said that they're going to, like, like, porn hubs said that they're going to go after them and try to take them down and have a war against deep fakes. But soon this technology is going to get so advanced, it's going to be impossible to tell what is real and what is not. And, you know, it's just, and obviously, even with the deep fake pornography, you could still see, you know, the kind of Facebook movie, the little, every frame is not matched up perfectly. It's soon to be almost impeccable and almost perfect and almost virtually impossible to even know the difference between what is real and what is fake. And that's a little scary there, Jason. Well, I want to let people know already that technology is available to a guy like me. It's not, you know, commercially available to somebody who can just get on a phone and be like, I want to put this here and make a video. No. That's how these things are happening, you know, through software like Adobe, you can go online right now if you've got a powerful enough PC, if you've got enough input devices. Yeah. You know, you got enough time rendering power. It's out there. It's something I've considered doing just to kind of make a point. Now if you've seen the Jennifer Lawrence Steve Bouchemmi video, that is pretty impeccable. That is extremely well done. Obviously using her voice and not steams, but facially, it's almost unrecognizable. You're watching something out of Bizarre world. It's a high level deep fake. And here's the thing. It's double-edged sword with technology guys. For instance, you know, you could have a criminal be caught on video, have a lot of money, have a lot of power. You don't know where the source of that video is. It's 20 years down the line. He claims deep fake. He really did the crime. He really murdered somebody on camera. Now the other side of that is somebody has a deep fake made of them murdering or doing something terrible to another person. And they don't have an alibi. They happen to be somewhere where maybe they didn't have their cell phone or they didn't have somebody around them and they can't verify that that's not them and they get convicted of that crime. These are just some of the moral conundrums that are going to come up with this tool. And let's face it, with these type of tools, you know, there's a lot of entertainment and parody possibilities. But there are a ton, ton of blackmail possibilities, real or fake, otherwise. Luke, you got anything else to say? Should I clear it out? I mean, this is pretty much a matches in line with what we talked about yesterday with Woody Harrelson's face being used to capture a beer thief. So the technological advancements are increasing in such a way that we have to be more critical and more skeptical than ever of what we see in here out there. And that's what we're trying to do here. Jason, you have to feel free to close it off.\n",

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying. The torn dress, the shattered look, was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture. As his tears fell on his daddy's face he heard these words again. I still remember the words, my brother said Tommy. I still remember the words, my brother said Tommy.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_175.mp3:  How sick is this? Black Kentucky Republican fires back after being told to stop eating. You ready for this? Cooon flakes. I'm Josh Bernstein-Fillinan for Gary Francy and the Next News Network. Now, before I get started, remember folks, Next News is being heavily censored. My channel, many other channels. So make sure you're still getting your subscribe, you're getting your notifications. Make sure that you are still getting everything that you need in order to find the show. A lot of people are saying that they're not getting the notifications. People are saying that they've had to re-subscribe to three, four times even. So they're doing it to my channel, they're doing it here, they're doing it all over the place. This is how they're trying to silence us. Even taking a status to just a video. So please, make sure double triple quadruple check. Make sure you get your notifications. Make sure you're still subscribed. If you're new to the channel, check out the newsletter in the description below. Now, let's get to your story. According to the EV4Dum from the Daily Caller, Daniel Cameron, a black Republican running for the Kentucky Attorney General, fired back on Wednesday after being told to quote, stop eating the Cooon flakes that the White House is serving, end quote, by a local radio host and attorney. His tweet reads, yesterday, a liberal attorney said that I should stop eating Cooon flakes in a at-corial journal interview. I am a proud lifelong Republican part of the diverse at Kentucky GOP ticket. And yes, I support at Real Donald Trump. It's time to stop telling black Americans what we are allowed to believe. End quote. Attorney Don Elliott has already received blowback for her remarks. Cameron, who is 33 years old, is running against a 67 year old Democrat named Greg Stumbo. Stumbo has stumbled at the annual fancy farm gathering on Saturday, a political event where both candidates for Attorney General spoke. After comparing Cameron to a child, something perceived as a racist trope, Stumbo's team quickly walked back the accusations that the quote, children line was racially charged. Look, we need more black Republicans. I've said this many times and I'll say it again. 40 and 25. If the Republicans can garner 40% of the Hispanic vote and 25% of the African-American vote, black vote in America, Democrats can't win. Democrats cannot win elections. Now, one more thing. This Don Elliott character? Well, I think she ought to hear from all of us. So look her up. Don Elliott in Kentucky. And what I would do is I would contact the radio station that she's on and tell them that you want her removed. She is a racist and she should be removed. You know what? They do it to us. Why not we do it to them for once, right? Go after her advertisers. Do what they do to Laura Ingram and do what they do to Tucker Carlson and everybody else. Let's give them a little payback. Those are my thoughts. What are yours? Put them down in the comments below. Give us a like. Give us a share. Continue to watch the next news network of Josh Bernstein filling in for Gary Franchey. If you want to learn more about me, check out the Josh Bernstein show on YouTube. And we'll see you on the next report. Well, now that you've watched that report, I want you to head on over to superpowerchecks.com and watch the video to learn how a unanimous act of Congress has sparked a $270 billion windfall across America. So the question I have for you, have you requested your $1,800 check? That's right. $1,818. Now, according to the video, it's a lot like social security, but you don't have to be retired. And you can grab 24 of these every year, as part of a brand new income program, explained in the video at superpowerchecks.com. Sign up for the distribution list and they show up in your mail without you lifting a finger. Thousands of Americans are celebrating these paydays. And now you can, too, by watching the educational video at superpowerchecks.com. We'll see you at the next report for the next news network. I'm Gary Franchi.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_607.mp3:  Let's move on to the final thing today. Kevin, where are you going to be living in a week? I don't know. I don't know. I'm supposed to be out of here by the first, which is on Monday, but I have no place to go. Conditions have changed at the place where I'm staying. It's not, it's not really directed at me. It's just that the use of the apartment is changing. I find myself in a very difficult situation because I don't earn very much, well, I don't earn any money. Actually, I get gifts from people occasionally. It's finding a place in Victoria. First and last month's rent, that sort of thing would be very difficult for me. I've applied for government housing, but there's a considerable waiting list for that. I may be literally homeless on Monday. I'm trying to think of a solution to that, but I don't know. This may be the end of the line for me. I hope to continue doing this show, but obviously if I don't have a place to stay and don't have a computer and the like, then I can't do it. I don't know. Ask for your prayers.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_149.mp3:  Saturday on, way down upon the Pwani River, or Shepherd. You all heard the song about the Pwani River. They tell you it's a pretty little song. All the benefits of people knowing nothing at all about the place, a lot of information I have got. Why the donkey in the diddy ever wanted to return? Is really something more than I can play. But I'm willing to admit the nigger showed a lot of things when he made up his mind to come away. Way down on the Pwani River, that's the place to give you information of the river. That's where the old folks love to say they got the stuff there because they cannot get away. Way down on the Pwani River, no more I wait too long. All the coos they say, I'm the last to get away. Far from the old folks at all. There are big alligators in the Pwani River that greet you with a playful little laugh. But if you are deluded by the evil, I gave it to my husband and the one that bites the queen in half. There are 40 kinds of fever you can catch him when you like and the country round about is made a month while the flavor of the atmosphere is fully guaranteed to stop the speculation of your blood. Way down on the Pwani River, that's the place to give you information of the river. That's where the crocodile skew your legs and the swans on the Pwani lay hard for legs. Way down on the Pwani River, no more I wait too long. All the coos they say, I'm the last to get away. Far from the old folks at all. That are great thick mosquitoes on the Pwani River that got a tooth or sharp on any pin. And they like to pick it in the tender parts of your anatomy that's why you have your trousers made a pin. When you wake up in the morning, all your bootshables and snakes it's a lively place for living in the garden. For half a dozen times a year the folks are flooded out. That's the only time they ever have a watch. Way down on the Pwani River, that's the place to give you information of the river. That's where the nanny goes to do things and the frogs quickly shrug all day long. Way down on the Pwani River, no more I wait too long. All the coos they say, I'm the last to get away. Far from the old folks at all.\n",

And I couldn't find anything else but these really opinionated frags of the Daily Dot and the other one is called News Hub, which is out of New Zealand. Alright, the Daily Dot goes, they're not going to read, I'm just going to read some stuff that's in here. But pretty much he has been booted from MailChimp because my God, he has opinions people don't like. Um, and I'll go through here and it goes, Hey, AtmailChimp, AtmailChimp appears. Did you know you know white, you power white nationalist and Stefan Malini's email newsletter? All new promotes eugenics, race science and men's rights activism. Okay, first off, I've listened and seen a lot of, of his stuff. Not everything, some stuff I'm like, meh, whatever. I don't do his college show. I think some of the stuff is kind of boring and preachy and I don't agree with everything he says. But he does not promote eugenics. Race science, he has talked about racial differences based on, what is it doing now? That's not what I read. Okay. Oh, this is, this is her getting ratioed. Black guy calling her cowards, a Maribol saying I would delete mail. I actually did this by accident. Sixth hex and hammer six. This is talk about virtue signaling. No research, either just ban. No, I want to tell you this in my personal pin. I mean, there's just a lot more. Geez, times of late mail chant before the determining your accounts because US sanctions or something. And this guy goes person goes, well, thank you for taking yourselves out of the running for me and deciding which service I use. I'm not going to volunteer you search that would cancel me to make Twitter happy. And it goes on and on and on. But I'm going to go through this. I don't know how, whatever. But, but I mean, I mean, he is, I mean, if you talk about, I mean, there's, I mean, he's talked about it. He's talked about, you know, with it from like different, you know, journals and books that have been written. But he doesn't really go into it. He does talk about about certain things and I'm not going to get into it. I'm not here to talk about that. It means rights. Oh my God. Men and women are different. Men and women have different needs and different rights issues. Just like men and women, they have different medical needs. I mean, get prostate cancer. Women don't because they don't have prostate. They can get testicular cancer. Women don't get testicular cancer. They don't have testicular. Yeah, I'm kind of doing the Jeff Fox with the thing. Just like men and women can both get breast cancer. They'll mainly affects women. Women can get get you to you to cancer and the uterus. I think you're tearing. I don't know. My that's the one that kind of have everybody. I don't where they can't say that one. Just kind of driving us today. And guys can't get that. They can't get can't get cancer and years because they're not the uterus. You know, women have certain medical issues. They have to deal with and women have certain medical issues. We have to deal with because we're different. You know, and which is which is an obvious thing. So certain there are certain issues where women's rights. Women have certain rights issues where they're being screwed over. Because they're women in certain cases. And that needs to be addressed. And if men are getting screwed over certain cases because they're being men, that needs to be addressed to people's rights. And we trust with them in a women. The fact that he's going to focus more on that we have tons of groups. Foc- over focusing on women's stuff. On focus on women's like it's crazy. But the minute you want to focus on how men are getting fucked over. And I do mean fucked over. Oh, people throw a fit. And this is great. But the fact that she did this and date. It's more like this was planned. She knew someone. I guarantee you this person knew someone male champ. And this was I'm telling you. I'm going to guess my guess is. I think I don't know for sure. This is my conclusion. This is my guess. I don't know why I came up with the conclusion. This is what my guess is. She knows someone at male champ. And this was this was a planned thing. This didn't come out of nowhere. Trust me. Because there was someone she knew at male champ, knew that Mike Stefan Maul knew but she just had to do something towards he could get the ball real quick. Trust me. And then when they go that, they go thank you for this. This rules. Think it's notice that they're using everything about how people like this rules. Like let me tell you something. If you don't defend the people you disagree with, because there are people out there who disagree with, I bet I agree they're right to say it. Because even people I disagree, they're once really come up to ideas like, oh, then think about that. You know, but these people are horrible people. And then he goes on, it's a stay later on, that if he had to go do the human struggle fight, he would. Because there's a lot of people that don't like him. And if you get hired by a company, that company, they found out they were from that company to get ratio until they had to fire him. And he is in Canada. This is online provocative Stefan Maul is being ridiculed over complaining he will be able to find regular permit after saying provocative things online. Well, it's true because they would look him up and the first thing that he would look under Google searches, how bad Stefan Maul is is, what type of jerk Stefan Maul is? You know, it's pretty much, they stack the deck against him. So the professor got signed, what about some of those people who could be found in the events of me being a, you know what? First off, if that guy worked for me, he wouldn't have a job for much longer. And then, see, this is everything from people who don't. People go, because what he's trying to say is when you do Google search in the Google algorithm is set up to screw you over. And like, it'll take everything people said. You said that they won't, they'll take it completely out of context. And he's got a point that he, you know, he can't, he's unemployable. But the thing though is, is it's like these attacks, like the good thing is like, I live in Texas. And in Texas, let's say I started working for this, there's actually some APC, there's actually some companies like called ABC, whatever, let's say I started working for, just let's say I started doing IT work for, put up an idea, so it's said to start doing IT work for Cisco. Okay. I've actually had calls from people that can go work at Cisco. I've actually interviewed for a couple of four. But I've actually worked for, come, I've actually worked for, I've actually worked for VMware before. One working for VMware, great company. Let's say that I got hired for Cisco. And I worked in Cisco, I'm just there at Fixed Computers, doing what I do. And someone, someone see some of my stuff online and says, hey, did you know he's a white, you know, he's this, that, the other look what he said. Well, and I get fired and I get put like, oh, because of this. Well, in Texas, I can actually sue that person for torsious interference of a contract. And in Texas, I can sue that person for contacting Cisco or people for contacting Cisco and getting the relief and get money for it and enough to cover my expenses and then they'll get for them slammed. And if they make it so bad that I can't get a job like poison to well for me, I get torsious interference with prospective contracts. And in that way, but they have to pay me for what money I might be able to make. I don't know if Canada has such laws, but in Texas, if since I'm in Texas, I always say I'm in Texas because of this. In Texas, if they would have done this, if he was in Texas, they would have done this. He and also, this is also defamation. And the reason why I say defamation, if you come here, this is worse defamation. They say he supports, promotes, is eugenics. And this is how he can get them in at least in Texas for defamation. I'm assuming I'm not a warrior. Don't play home, don't want to TV. My dad was a warrior, but nearly this is just conjecture. This is just guessing a real warrior could answer this. But I think this would also be a case for defamation. And the reason is she accused you of doing eugenics. Re-science. And then said, men rights, doing activitions for the rights of men is a bad thing. Therefore, she basically decided he promotes eugenics by the way, which he doesn't. I'm pretty, which I'm 99% sure he does it. And he said, I never say 100% because there's always that one time, like, oh, I didn't know he supported that. I would never guess. But he doesn't, so he does not say, heck, I don't even support eugenics. I think he says a horrible thing. Um, in genetics, by the way, came from the Democrat party. This is mainly Democrats who did that crap and not Republicans. They're here in the United States. Um, but calling saying that that he supports eugenics and eugenics, and by opinion, is a horrible thing is that is defamation. In this non-deni-jamming, I was saying a name of, I did say her name wrong. I'll apologize. I'll only apologize to the same people saying strong because sometimes I'm just trying to guess. Well, this young lady here could get the living crap suit out of her. Okay. And the fact that she's admitting to it, it's like, look, this is what the big man, the man, the case. Now, I know the judge kicked a lot of stuff out, but it's being appealed. Now, I'm telling you on appeal, a lot of stuff's going to come back. And he's pretty much going to, um, I think he's going to end up winning this case. And, um, in my opinion, um, you never know. But he's pretty much going to win a lot of the case. Um, so, but yeah, that's about it. Um, if I, if I was Stefan, and if this woman is in Canada, it's not a state, there might be not much, not much he can do. But if he, uh, he was in Canada, um, he might be able to sue, if they say she's in Canada between being a Canadian. Now, I don't know Canadian law. I don't know how it works. But he can sue her for defamation. Basically, we're claiming that because she got him now, now I know in the United States for what he did, what she did. This causes you cause damages to this person, all right. And this is where the laws need to be loosened. So it's easy to sue people for doing crap like this. You know, maybe if some of these people were to pay like a hundred thousand or get a million dollar judgment against her for pulling stunts like this, this would stop. Yeah, not the legal court for putting her in jail for this, but maybe make, make her pay the victim a million dollars because guess what? When it comes, where did he comes in discovery and find out that she was working colluding with someone in MailChimp to do this? Or guess what? She can then sue, she might be able to sue MailChimp. He might be able to sue MailChimp. Maybe not MailChimp or the person in MailChimp. If I own MailChimp, I would be what the after you doing get the heck out. Like I said, we don't know what we really don't know it's behind us, but I'm like I said earlier and I don't want to repeat, you know what I said earlier. I'm kind of wrap it up now. A. This lady did a tweet got stuff I'm all in you removed from MailChimp. Um, two, I think that she knew someone in MailChimp, this was a planned action in my opinion. This is my personal opinion to he has an I believe he has a right to case to sue for defamation and for damages because she defamed him. All right. The problem is why I can't say white nationalist because he might be getting for white nationalist because she's saying he's a racist too. And all this stuff saying that he's a racist and pleading to be genetics to consume her for defamation and maybe get damages between the law and the law says and she's the United States. I don't know because you're crossing national borders and this is what becomes complicated. So. And not the image because the damage the left is doing to him because they don't like his views. Um, he's going to be hard for him to find another employment because he makes his money basic as a business man online. And hey, I don't know how he can be doing fine financial for all I know he can be doing great. I don't know. I don't know how he's doing financially so. But um, that's about it. How many comments below and also um, that's in tell me what you think. Right. And the hit the like button if you like it.\n",

What do you think about that? Well, my first reaction to this story was that Ben Shapiro is consistently claiming to see anti-Semitism in corners of politics where it's non-existent. And yet at the same time, he's inspiring anti-Semites around the United States. So the Supreme irony of that is not lost on me and it shouldn't be lost on the rest of us. He was screaming and crying about Ilan Omar and her comments that were taken out of context. And then you have Ben Shapiro fans that are spray painting swastikas on synagogues. So I think that's a little bit more anti-Semitic than Ilan Omar comments that were maybe not worded in the exact perfect way that Ben Shapiro would want.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_573.mp3:  Explosive allegations against Jeffrey Epstein in the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office coming out of New York. Contact Favon Escaiator, Mirrors Badcock joins us to explain Mirrors. An attorney representing some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims says he personally knows of several young women who were allowed to visit Epstein while he was on work release here in Palm Beach County in 2008. The women claimed they were solicited for sexual favors by Epstein while he was on work release at a downtown West Palm Beach office and he was being monitored by PBSO deputies at the time. Now this was a benefit afforded to the convicted sex offender while he was incarcerated from 2008 to 2009 on one charge of procuring prostitution from a minor. Now part of the plea deal that is all part of a plea deal that has made headlines since his recent arrest in New York on federal new charges. Information that we've received from victims, including at least one who personally visited him was that it was not for some business arrangement and it was for if you were in jail improper sexual contact. Now the sheriff's office says that's not true. A spokeswoman tells me Epstein was quote quote carefully guarded and allowed no friends or family or guests. She says there are 464 records which back this up. We've been asking for those records along with a visitor log from the sheriff's office and we're waiting on a response back to you.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_375.mp3:  Alright everyone, let's stop at Stanny. So at Don Don Me last night, I was up, couldn't sleep very well, just thinking about all kinds of stuff, about what's going on in the Middle East, and then I started reading some news articles, and I was just like, oh, I couldn't sleep. So then at Don Don Me, Tel Aviv is the gay capital of the world. And we're over there in the Middle East fighting wars for Jews. And at Don Don Me, we'll no wonder we're over there fighting wars for Jews. They're a bunch of fucking faggots. They're too busy sucking each other's dicks, and having gay butt sex in order to go fight their own wars. They're a bunch of fucking pussy's. Everyone knows we're over there fighting for Jews. All you have to do is look at the news. You see BB and Trump, like basically giving each other hand jobs on stage. You know, BB, I read this article last night saying, oh, we need to take a backseat approach, and let Donald Trump deal with this. This is his problem. We didn't cause this issue. Give me a break. We all know they're the ones funding ISIS. We know that they're, we're there. Just there to serve Israel, the greater Israel project. Now, isn't this interesting? I talk about this stuff on YouTube, and I get kicked off. I've been getting kicked off for making relatively calm videos being anti-war. I'm much more amped up at this point, because I'm pissed. And I share this, like, I don't know, 25 second clip of Hillary Clinton talking on mainstream media, saying if she was elected president, she'd go to war with that ran first thing. And I might comment on the title was basically like, oh, I voted for Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton. They removed the video and gave me a friggin' strike. I didn't even say anything myself. All it was is a 25 second video of Hillary Clinton. I'm gonna put it on a bit shoot now. I'm gonna put it on telegram. I'm gonna put it on Facebook, whatever. This is ridiculous. So if you wanna be a good American, you wanna be a patriot, I'll tell you what to do. Go sign up for the military, and go over to the Middle East, and get yourself blown up for some fucking Jews. That's what you gotta do. Go tell your sons and daughters to go over to the Middle East and get blown up for fucking Jews, so they can suck each other's dicks and have gay butt sex with each other. That's it. That's all there is to it. And speaking of this, I mean, just look at the amount of a supremacy that Israel is causing. They've got a wall around their entire country. They don't let anybody. You have to be Jewish in order to get in. If I want those same things as a white man, I'm called a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi. What a bunch of bullshit. So again, just go over and fight for Jews. Let's think, they can go suck each other's dicks and have butt sex and share AIDS with one another. And we'll go over there and fight and die for the fucking Jews. Just go be some fucking goyum. Go be some good goyum. And go die for the fucking Jews.\n",

But while driving my Tahoe, my GTS-ness calculated directions, created a path through the wrong neighborhood I glanced over and there they stood, a group of emaciated men addicted to wood. That's right, I was staring straight at a pack of fangs. This was sending red flags, somehow I drove into Clear Street, grabbed my walk in the heartbeat. The clan rally had to wait. My priority was to kill this group of eight as bandits who were underway, probably from the HIV infecting their bodies and mind. So I walked behind one of the cockjockies and blew out his brains adrenaline rushing through my veins trampled over the death banks' remains and fired into the backs of the shitstabbers hauling ass from the scene, but their ass was grass, if you know what I mean. True flying-stropping like craze mowing down daisies, my vision was hazy because I was a little bit smoked some good shit beforehand. But I still managed to blow away the gaze, wrapping the trip okay, my lunar abilities on display. Managed to find the rally before it ended, and despite not arriving at the time intended it was splendid, but driving on to Clear Street wasn't so bad executing home OS's wrath. Next time I'll get here a tad bit earlier so I don't miss much of the rally I should travel to South Cali for my summer vacation. I hear it's the game as part of the nation. More Clear Streets for me to wipe out I just told my GPS knows the route. San Bernardino will look like child's play after the moon rises.\n",

As I bring up the state of Maryland, I want to say something about how I was introduced to the US Israel relationship. Before I was even born, my father was in the Congress of the United States, Thomas Delisandro Jr. He was a, okay, let's hear it for dad. He was a little teenager, a Shabbat boy. So he spoke Yiddish. So as he grew up in that and he was an art, a great speaker in all the rest. And he had a love for the idea of a Jewish state in what was then called Palestine. So when he was older and he went to Congress, this was one of his big issues. He worshiped at the shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a New Deal Democrat. He worshiped at the shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. I can disagree with him on two very strong points. One was on the treatment of Jewish people in Europe that he wanted to call more attention to. And two, okay. He, as a second was the establishment of a Jewish state in what was then known as Palestine.\n",

I'm from Pittsburgh and on Monday, I lost my job ending the first period of financial stability I've ever had in my life. When I joined DSA, I had less than $5 to my name and I was homeless. I joined DSA after a comrade who's actually here today. Thank you, Crystal. Paid my dues for me. I was between jobs and had just dropped out of college for the second time. I was lost, scared and suicidal. DSA meetings became my rock. Pittsburgh is deeply committed to snacks at meetings which I am deeply thankful for. As those were among the rare meals I was able to count on. CB23 also removes the only gendered language in our Constitution and would make sure that the DSA Constitution is inclusive of gender non-conforming and non-binary comrades. As a co-author of CB23, I've been asked, why don't we just make dues arbitrarily small, something like $5, a cup of coffee? Please hear me when I say that when you have 86 cents to your name and no groceries to eat, $5 is insurmountable. I have also been asked if this would create a system of paper members who join but don't contribute. Please hear me when I say that a socialist organization should value its members because of how much they're able to contribute or we should not value because of how much they are able to contribute. We should value them because our lives are inherently important. Please hear me when I say that nobody is too poor for DSA and please vote yes on CB23. Please hear me when I say that nobody is too poor for DSA and please vote yes on. Please hear me when I say that nobody is too poor for DSA and please vote yes on.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_599.mp3:  And that applies to Jews as well as anybody else. So strong identified Jews tend to have strong, positive views in their in-group, strongly negative views of outsiders. And you know, that's part of the culture of critique that these Jewish intellectuals have very negative views about the culture and peoples of the outside them. One of the questions about the spread of the Frankfurt School of ideology in the United States, and especially in universities, is how they jumped so quickly from being a handful of people in key universities to dominating the university system. It was their presence throughout the system. While Boazian anthropology was spread by a careful process of the development of cadres and placing them in key positions over the course of a generation, the Frankfurt School very quickly came to ascendancy all across American higher education. And this has always remained kind of a mystery, but I think part of the mystery is explained by the role of the new school for social research and its agenda, which was through credential Jewish refugees from Europe before, during and after World War II. These people were credentialed in a very pro-former manner, very few of them did anything like what we would consider coursework. They were simply given advanced degrees. They turned out torrents of PhDs and moreover, this was part of a broader stream of European Jews, many with phony credentials coming into the United States, at the very moment of the largest expansion of the American university system in its history, which was during the GI Bill after World War II. Suddenly there was a need for thousands of new professors. And these could not be conservatives because they were still politically risky after World War II, but Jews were considered to be morally pure because of their terrible suffering and their credentials were never looked at too closely. Suddenly there were thousands, tens of thousands of new professors, and they all held this ideology, which was an ideology that was based on advancing their own interests.\n",

We're not excessive. It's an intense moment. You're allowed for it to be served. Yes, you are. I can't stand up. You should put it in. You're allowed for it to be served. It's the point of arrest. I understand that, Sarah. But we're not going to use excessive force to get you done. You're not excessive. It's an intense moment. It's an intense moment. Hey. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Like many of you, I was shocked and angry when I watched this video. There's no excuse for the way this girl was treated. As a chief of police, I'm extremely disappointed that we failed to perform at our expected standards.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_515.mp3:  Dr. Carrie Maday. She is a medical expert who has done research for decades and she has found some extremely disturbing things about the upcoming vaccine for COVID-19. Dr. Carrie Maday has been the medical director of two large clinics. She has a vast medical experience and we are honored to have her here. I want to encourage you to watch this video to the end so you can hear what she has to say. This may well be the most important video you will ever watch in your life. I am very excited to be here and I feel it's very urgent that we get this information out to everyone. I started researching vaccines probably in my early 20s. I've been very interested in them but never before have I seen the technology being used on this proposed COVID-19 vaccine never before. First of all this vaccine will be using a modified RNA or modified DNA in the vaccine. So why is this important? It's important to know because it could potentially alter our DNA, our genome and what's the big deal about DNA or RNA, well our genome. Well the genome is what makes us human, what separates us from the rest of the animals and plants in the world. It's the blueprint for what creates us, what how we reproduce, how we function, how we repair, how we evolve. So one little change, one little protein inserted, one taken out, one changed, can actually create the congenital defect or a redditary disorder. So a little change is grand. So something that can alter that could really be devastating on us humans, right? So they're proposing uses technology and part of this is called transfections. Okay? Transfection is the same technology being used to make a genetically modified organism such as a tomato or corn and the grocery store. And we all know that Monsanto is pretty well known for making genetically modified organisms and they're not as healthy as the organic, the wild type that you see out to nature. So if this is the same technology being used on the plants, well what would happen to us humans? Potentially we would not be as healthy, okay? And I want to remind everyone that this is the first time that it would be used on humans large scale. We would be the experiment. We would be the lab rats. We don't have long-term studies. So this is very, very important to know. Let me just go and show you or tell you about one of the front runners for this vaccine. That is Moderna. Moderna has been given about $1 billion from the US government for research and development. It's backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So they have a lot of money backing them. I want to let you know they're kind of the new kids on the block. They really have not been around for that long. They have never developed a human vaccine nor a human medicine ever. This is their first run at it. Also just to know for you to know that they have gone from fast track there are vaccine light years. Okay so they went from a lab you know experiment to phase two which is using only 45 human subjects in 63 days. Two months. That's crazy. We should have years behind that. And I'm going to remind you that this is the first time they've ever developed a vaccine. Their early studies so far showed that and their their phase two which is using 45 human subjects when they did introduce this vaccine into the human subjects 100% of the high dose vaccine group 100% got systemic side effects and the low dose vaccine group 80% got systemic side effects. So already we're seeing initially side effects. Now long term we don't know. So on Moderna one of the the the ways that they could apply this would be a proposal would be going to use a bandage called a micro needle pet platform. So micro needle platform would be a bandage that you could get in the mail like Amazon or UPS. It's a bandage you would apply on your hand here and then you take the sticker off and then voila you have a vaccine. You do it yourself. So how are they doing this? The bandage has tiny little micro needles on it and it's designed after a snake fang or a viper fang so it's like a bite from a snake but many of them and they say you really won't feel it but it goes into your skin and the little tiny micro needles will be injected. So what's in a micro needle? It'll be either the DNA or the RNA vaccine. Number two it'll be something called Luciferase. Now this is very important to know they patented an enzyme called Luciferase. Okay. So this is called Luciferase. They claim because it gives a bioluminescence a light. Okay and it's not something you can see or feel but if you have a special device like a smartphone app with a special application you can scan over it and it will light up. It'll show a pattern, a digital code, a barcode, a tattoo. We're going to be branded. Each person will have their own ID. You know this reminds me of World War II. You know it's something to think about being branded like a product in the store. So that will be in there and that will hold proof that you're being vaccinated. They want to make sure that you're scanned and that you've gotten the vaccine. So we'll be branded. What could that be used for? Well there's lots of technologies out there but it's something that we need to be concerned about. So there's two things. We have a brand new experimental DNA RNA vaccine that could potentially alter our genome. And number two we're going to be tattooed or branded with an ID. And then number three, there'll be this is all in a hydrogell. So hydrogell is a technology that was invented by DARPA, Department of Advanced Research Project Agency. Now this is a small part of the Pentagon or the Department of Defense. They make the sci-fi inventions that you might hear about. So this is one of their inventions. You can look up on YouTube, HydroGel, the company Profusa and DARPA and you'll see some clips of some of the technology of this. So this is a special technology because it goes under the skin. It's the body doesn't reject it and it has nanotechnology which are microscopic, microscopic, robotic organisms. So these microscopic organisms that are robotic will be in your body. Okay. They can assemble, disassemble and reassemble and to do innumerable things into the body. So the idea of this would be it's a way for it to gather information from your body. So you could get your blood pressure, your blood sugar, your heart rate which sounds good. Okay. Gather that information. However, it's also has a potential to be used for other things. It can gather how many steps you've taken if you fall in. If you're swimming, if you're running, if you're menstruating, how your menstrual cycle goes, if you're having sex, if you're sleeping, it actually has a potential to know your emotions. Okay. All of this data 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year is being accumulated. And where's it going? While they claim it goes to a smart app like your phone, the iCloud or any smart device, but who's getting this information? Who is using it? What are they using it for? That has not been answered. So the other important thing to know is they're gathering all this information about us. And we're putting that out. So we're being connected to artificial intelligence. You have to know this is not just a vaccine. We're being connected to artificial intelligence. So just like a phone, you have your smartphone, you can send it to you can send an email, but then the phone or someone else can send something back to you to your phone. That means something can send something back to your body, messages, information. What could what could happen from that? I could imagine that you could be affected with your mood or your behavior, your memory. That could really cause a lot of problems, a lot of confusion. And who's in charge of this? The Department of Defense, Bill and Melinda Gates? Who's doing this? We don't have answers yet. But this is something real to know. This is being proposed. And I don't know if you've heard of something called ID 2020, but it's also the idea that everybody will have a unique identifier. And from that identifier, everything will happen. We will not be credit cards. We won't need cash. Well, this is the beginning of the unique identifier, this branding, this tattoo. This means the end of cash, the end of credit cards. This is the beginning of all of this. Okay, the loss of autonomy, the loss of independence, the loss of privacy. We have to really know what these people are intending to do. So the HydroGel also, the companies are claiming that the HydroGel has a potential to be an on-demand drug delivery system. Okay, and I'm not saying it's coming in this vaccine, but I'm saying this is the same technology you need to know this. So an on-demand drug delivery, that means that through a light application, that a drug could be delivered into your body. Well, that's a little concerning because I know if I take a medicine, I have a tablet and a bottle that has a label, I see the tablet, it has a unique identifier on the tablet and I take it and I know when I take it, I'm in control. But what if something, it has a light source, and I'm not quite sure what they mean by that, but that is what they're talking about, can activate something in your body. What if you don't know it's been activated? What if there's a problem with it? I mean, could you imagine the implications of this? What if a bunch of people are rioting at a control? Could something be stimulated in you to sedate you? I can imagine in the wrong hands, this could be very dangerous, is that part of the reason of our military being involved. I'm just giving you some ideas to be critical thinkers and to know what they're proposing in these vaccines and to research these things for yourself. You really have to know how it's not just a vaccine or giving us. They're manipulating our DNA, our genome, and you know, they say it's temporary, but I'm telling you that when you manipulate the genome with transfection, you can make it permanent. It is a possibility and they won't know that until they do it to all of us. Do you want to take that chance?\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_461.mp3:  The Black community in America, like many others, has a culture comprised of strong in-group preference. Despite things like this proportionally high rate of Black on Black crime, there still exists a near universal mutual respect shared by Black people for being Black, even if it's not expressed explicitly. Because of that, racial betrayal is one of the most emotionally charged offenses within the Black community, and titles for this offense range from Uncle Tom to Sambo to House Nigger and most commonly, Coon. Now, I know a lot of right-wing conservative-linear Blacks will argue that Coon is just a term used to silence Blacks for wrong think. Others will probably argue that it's just another cancerous form of identity politics. And sometimes that is true, but not always. And while some people Black and non-Black alike may not recognize the concept of Coon to be legitimate, in the Black community, it is an established cultural axiom. In this video, I wanted to take a shot at explaining, from the perspective of a Black person, what exactly makes someone guilty of being a Coon? Let's get started. First, let's define our terms. Now, there's a lot of different definitions for the work Coon. According to Urban Dictionary, Coon is a Black actor or actress who takes roles that stereotypically portrays Black people, which I'm not sure is accurate because I find examples like character James Carter from Rush Hour, who is the stereotypical Black American sidekick to be fucking hilarious, or the boys of Summer from the Wire who play the role of stereotypical young Black American men selling drugs. I love all these characters, and to my knowledge, they're all equally beloved by a majority of Black demographics too. So I'm not sure if it's only cooning when it's a stereotype that Black people don't like, or you know whatever. Another definition according to Webster is an insulting or contemptuous term for a Black person. Again, while vaguely true, these definitions aren't really what I'm talking about. So since I couldn't find a definition that matches the context of which I'll be referring to the term throughout this video, I wouldn't have had to wrote my own. In my opinion, I think a sufficient definition of the word coon as it's most commonly used by Black people would be this. A Black person displaying favoritism to non-Black people, usually white, whilst collectively condemning their own race for not being more culturally identical to the race they favor. The reason I chose this definition is because the nature of cooning isn't how many describe it. It's not merely acting white, nor is it merely black on Black criticism. Rather, cooning is a sociological action, one that requires a conscious intent to subvert or defame Black identity. We'll get into some examples of what I would say are reasonable perceived cases of cooning in just a bit, but first, let's talk about what cooning is not. Oftentimes, people misattribute cooning to mean anything another Black person does that they themselves don't like. And when people unresinably use language, it makes the meaning of the term pretty useless, and the term coon has been hella abuse in this respect. For example, a Black person having a romantic relationship with someone of another race is not inherently cooning. Is it possible that they're doing so because they have insecurities about their own race, culture, etc. and wants to distance themselves from their Blackness? Sure. It's also possible that they have no issue with being Black, and the person accusing them of cooning are themselves insecure, and are projecting their emotions onto an innocent relationship. It's much more likely that you're just salty and bitter because they didn't choose you, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody feelings. Another example of unreasonable use of the word coon is the classic you talk white. If you're so stupid as to think that the adoption of proper English means that someone is pandering to whites, brah. Being literate is not in opposition to Black people or Black culture. Other examples include claims that, you know, wearing your jeans, ways high makes you a coon, straightening or coloring your hair makes you a coon, not voting for Obama or Democrats makes you a coon. I could go on and on with how stupid some of this shit can be, and I've learned from experience that trying to reason with stupid people is more than often a waste of time, so we're gonna leave it at that. While these are some of the dumbest examples of coon accusations, they still fall under the definition outlined earlier, that being a perception of disloyaltees the Black Collective. But now let's talk about some other examples of cooning, which even I, as a pretty solid individualist, can understand being classified as such. Cooning from my experience seems to manifest itself in one of two forms, those being passive and aggressive. Passive cooning is probably the most common. A good example of this phenomena would be CNN host Don Limon. Now Don is someone who I'll criticize for a number of things. His maitrean left his propaganda, his incessant whining about racism or his hilariously mediocre career as a journalist. I would love to spend more time with you. You are an incredible guy. Thank you so much. What the hell is your brother in a show for? I put you on the show to get you one to talk about your your series. We talked for a long time actually. I know we talked for a long time off the camera. The new show Mike Tyson mysteries he airs every Monday night. Don Limon is full of him. I don't doubt this one. Thank you Mike Tyson. I love you. Hello me too. But none of those things make him a coon. Instead, Don Limon's cooning stems from his appeals to improve the black community by whitewashing the culture. You see, Don Limon is his mainstream mainstream black's come. He's made a career out of assimilating into the milieu of white elites. And he's spared quite well as a result. Not only Limon, but plenty of other black personalities. Charles Barkley, Ben Carson, Stacy Dash, Raven Simone, etc. The one thing all these guys have in common is an express favor of Eurocentric or mainstream American culture over black American culture. But I call it passive cooning because the favor of white culture expressed by these individuals is, well, passive. And it isn't followed up with an explicit disperagement of black people or black culture, which is usually a tactic of aggressive cooning. Unlike passive cooning, aggressive cooning is an act where a black person consciously divorces themselves from black culture, again in conjunction with the typical adoption of white American culture. A prime example of what could be perceived as aggressive cooning would be tree of logic. Let me preface this by making clear that this isn't me taking shots in calling tree a coon. You know, to my knowledge, we were cool until I randomly discovered she'd block me on Twitter. But that's besides the point. I'm only using tree as a strategic illustration, you know, it's not personal. So first, let me explain a little bit of background. Tree of logic is a YouTuber whose channel somewhat overlaps with mine in that we're both black right wing YouTubers, which is basically a niche category because they're so few of us. Anyway, myself and tree both at one point has some pretty vocal alliances with the alt-right. As of late, I noticed we both slowly begun to separate ourselves from the movement. Now I did so gradually in favor more so of promoting black capitalism and free association type stuff. Tree however, seemed to do so at the blink of an eye after she got BTFO by Mike Enoch on the JQ. She decided to chimp out and retreat back to normic conservatism. Where I might add, she's now hyperactively shilling for Israel and non-racist white conservatives, which is, you know, it's whatever you do use this. Now that's the background. Here's how I believe she could be interpreted as a coon for this behavior. Tree of logic has openly said that she allied with the alt-right only because she wanted to defend white people from the anti-white left. I have been a YouTuber for a year and a half now and during that time, I have made 11 anti-black class madda videos and for self-defense instructional videos encouraging and plating with white people to protect themselves and defend themselves against anti-white individuals. I have always been forthcoming about my quest to help keep white people the majority here in America and I have viciously fought against anti-white hatred. Now this is quite different from my reason, which were voluntary separatism and decentralization of culture, but that's fine. You know, she saw white people as a group being bullied and wanted to defend them. Now she's doing so with the Jews, you know? Okay, some could construe that as cooning, but there's really not enough evidence to accuse her of it, unless you're one of those black people who think that, you know, any black person who's friendly towards white people is a coon. Or I could even be charitable and say that trees rushed to white night for white people in Jews is more so due to her conservatism than anything. After all, I've also observed her to be dismissive of virtually any criticism towards police or Trump in what comes across as a dogmatic loyalty to blue lies matter in a boomer tier mega fetish. It's possible she could just be dogmatically defending white people in Jews because of her politics, not her version to blacks. However, that's not all she believes. Tree of logic also happens to hold heavy contempt towards the black community, not even necessarily certain elements within it, but the group as a whole. You see, she doesn't seek to disassociate with the entire white community, just because she doesn't like the alt-right side of it. But as shown in this tweet, she's eager to disassociate from the black community as a whole, presumably due to her disdain for groups like black lives matter. So, if that's true, then I could see why one would come to the conclusion that she's a coon, because she is displaying favoritism to non-black people whilst collectively condemning her own race for not being more culturally similar to the race she prefers. Aggressive cooning is by far an extreme rarity, not only because of the huge amounts of energy I suspect must go into impassioned counter-signaling of the collective, but more so, it's social consequences in terms of a personal relationship to the culture. And this brings me to the final point I wanted to touch on, and that's the consequential result of being accused of being a coon. Most black Americans are natively settled in communities that have a distinctive blackness to them. Now, this can be defined in a number of ways such as the food, the music, the behavioral norms, the language, etc. In essence, blackness is just a synonym for common culture. To be black genetically is not necessarily translitive to being black culturally, or being accepted as part of the cultural ingroup. I want to make sure this is understood because it's something that seems to be lost on many non-black people who object to the term coon. There's a real world relevance behind the meme of who gets invited to the cookout. Being of African descent doesn't necessarily mean your entitled to a plate. In fact, a non-black person who is unequivocally removed from black culture is far more likely to be welcomed by the community than a black person who's a cultural outcast. I think it is important to add that sometimes people who are black but don't really reflect black culture are incorrectly categorized as coons. And this is for lack of better terms problematic. Probably the most well-known synonym for coon is Uncle Tom. Now, the term Uncle Tom originated from the book Uncle Tom's cabin, where in the original writing he actually accepted being brutally beaten to death by his slave master because he refused to address against his fellow slaves or assist in their capture in order to do so. However, after the various film adaptations in the 1930s, the term Uncle Tom was repopularized to mean a slave who showed unconditional loyalty and servitude to the master. Stereotypically, an Uncle Tom would serve as the master's right hand nigger, you know, receiving special privileges, authority over other slaves and increased compassion from the master relative to the treatment of other slaves that is. But another party who also received similar privileges and compassion were the house slaves. Now, house slave could sometimes be an Uncle Tom, but it wasn't an absolute. Oftentimes house slaves were chosen not merely because of their obedience to the plantations hierarchy, but their fair skin, their attractiveness, and even secretive relations to the master. It wasn't terribly uncommon for the unclaimed children conceived between the whites and the slaves to be granted refuge from fieldwork because of their familiar relation. Now, I know some of you are wondering why I went on this totally random tangent, but this is another important point that I failed to mention earlier in understanding what a coon by modern standards is not. Oftentimes, people will call other blacks who are simply raised outside of black culture or coon. I actually recall back in middle school, we had a student join who had just moved from London. Let's call him D. Anyway, he was picked on pretty regularly. Regrettably, I was good to give this as well. But he was teased and joned because he had a strong African-British accent. He was pretty feminine, either gay or metrosexual, and he didn't really act black, you know, as most of the students knew it. Now, my school was 99% black, consistently from elementary through high school, East Metro, Atlanta. And as a result, the school was culturally homogenous. So when D.K. many people have accused him of being a coon because you could tell he had a distinct European fashion sense. He had European vernacular and mannerisms, etc. But I think it's important to distinguish between a black person who favors white culture and projects that favoritism onto black communities, such as Don Lemon, from a black person who simply reflects the culture of which they were raised in, like D. A house slave who was merely raised around whites and has had white culture impressed upon them isn't the same as an Uncle Tom who consciously rejects and works to displace blackness. By the way, I'm not saying that black people who are raised in white dominant cultures are house slaves. It's just the metaphor. The reason I wanted to bring this up is because I want people to know that being labeled a coon isn't always a mundane thing. For people like me is whatever because I don't really value external opinions nearly as much as most people. Besides, most of the weirdos who call me coon are internet niggas talking shit over Twitter. Most of the time white liberals. Guarantee you defend them try to accuse me of that shit within my Atlanta social circles. They'd be laughed out of the room. But for others, it can have some pretty impactful social ramifications. It's similar to being labeled a snitch in that regard. It can dissolve social trust, picture from established relationships, and in some extreme cases even put your safety at risk. Kind of like the effect of being labeled a Nazi or a white supremacist. While there are some legit Nazis out there, oftentimes the term is just a loaded smear campaign intended to silence or harm ideological opponents. And a lot of people unfortunately use coon in the same way. While in my opinion the term does have a legitimate role in being used, it's much more common for it to just be weaponized by malicious people who don't like what you say or how you at. Anyway guys that's going to do it for this video. There's no real solution to the malicious use of the word coon. But I think if more people really understand what the term means and better understand how to use the language, it could be mitigated. And that's what I hope this video can serve as. In the black community, we have a unique language that for the most part is commonly understood. I think I've even seen it refer to as af-African-American vernacular English or black-English, whatever you want to call it. It's cultural communication and I think it's important for us to better solidify the meaning and intended usage of these terms. Eventually the repeated real world usage of the term will establish a sort of pseudo consensus. I just want to make this video anyway. Add in my own take explaining how I believe black people should define the term.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_312.mp3:  Oh, it's music to my ears. Oh, man. How can I describe the way I feel? Oh, it's a fucking great mind. Okay, let me see. How could I begin? Back from an afternoon of gunning down Laxon West, I'm in a studio listening to a brand new set of tracks from the Cloud Mad. A canvas at his best, yet in the prepped flip the switch and pump gas again. My lunar sense is signal to me a massive threat to the internet from people who want to band the web. So I go back again to the mad and net because I need to see the reason for the mad. Kevac and Holy shit. Now what is this? A man against the spread of Doom Coons into the white land and then I learn he brought his whole armory and camera. And he like him himself killing the sanded men. I find the video New Zealand try to band the web from possessing to see the kind of mass effect that Mr. Brent and Tarant could have had. On then they even try to band a motherfucking man a fest, oh no they fucking wonder why there was a man possessed with so much anger at the state of man to get off his ass. Get a gun and take a stand against my genocide real plan that I can attest to bagpipes from Price Church. When will it ever cease see the stream is evil to speak the least bagpipes from Price Church. What's going through his head as he chits and that shoots the dead again. Bagpipes from Price Church. Some would be hit up all the ISPs kill the stream they can't see it. Bagpipes from Price Church. He's on the road again many shot dead. Then deserve. He could be a permanent fixture in my triple K mixture. He's a triple K whipped resistor of shit. If you raise Tarant could have killed shits for days covered in dust after all the bullets were sprayed. He's a real life shit poster of my own make the manifestos worth a read for its own sake. I read the whole thing in 20 with no break a perfect plot what when he went to go and take out the enemy he faltered as often as he fired using a little more ammo than was required. Tapping spare magazines has the attack transpired that execution left a little to be desired. I could sit here and nitpick the guy all day on how he started outside instead of in the hallway. But the point of the attack was to make a doorway for the world's division and for the great long race. Or to begin at last even if undeclared when they see the moon rise they will all be scared. It's the exact world wide reaction that dears us all to make so snowflakes that are prepared for your begpipes from Price Church. When will it ever cease to see the stream he's evil to speak the least? begpipes from Price Church. What's going through his head has you chiseled and that shoots the dead again. begpipes from Price Church. Somebody hit up all the ISP till the stream they can't see it. begpipes from Price Church. He's on the road against many shots dead than deserved death. Now today I wait to see if Tarant was successful in the division mission. They better be careful if they want to keep the populace restful. Forget the lousy common men awake up address will divest love and troll back from the ones who hate white men. They will go even further right and adjust white scent. The real problem all back to the right camp is where the end begins and where the hike ends. So far so good you've all taken your sides and you're acting as predicted in Tarant's right and pushy and he is hooked and the left is star right and for gun control. And all things so hurt white scent, clansmen and chansmen are for once united and the left and the right are further divided. Time will tell if this is the spark that drives it one thing. Is for sure you'll be all invited by the begpipes from Price Church. When will it ever cease to see the stream he's evil to speak the least? begpipes from Price Church.

Nicht in Schiener, Iran oder sonstigen Fernländern, sondern in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. In Deutschland werden politische und wissenschaftliche Fragen durch einen engen Meinungskorridor gezwängt. Gedanken und Äußerungen, die nicht hindurch passen, werden an Straßen geknüpft. Angefangen mit öffentlicher und sozialer Echtung, bis hin zur Innafthierung. Diese Menschen haben niemandem etwas weggenommen, haben niemandem Gewalt angetan, haben niemanden verletzt oder beraubt. Sie haben lediglich ihren Mund aufgemacht oder kritische Fragen gestellt. Einer dieser Menschen ist Ursula Haferbeck. Am 7. Mai 2018 wurde die damals 90-Jährige international bekannte Dizidentin und Bürgerrechtlerin Ursula Haferbeck in ihrem Haus in Floto festgenommen und in die Ott-VAA-Bielefeld-Prakwede gebracht. Seitdem sitzt sie mittlerweile im geschlossenen Vollzug eine mehrjährige Haftstrafe wegen Meinungsdelikten ab. Mit einer baldigen Haftentlassung ist nicht zu rechnen. Seit der Innafthierung vor einem Jahr gab es unzählige Solidaritätsaktionen in ganz Deutschland. Partei und Gruppen übergreifend werden die Proteste für die sofortige Freilassung von Ursula Haferbeck unterstützt. Zum 91. Geburtstag der innafthierten Bürgerrechtlerin Ursula Haferbeck findet am 9. November in Bielefeld eine Demonstration statt, die mitten durch die Innenstadt zum Justizkomplex führt. Wie kann es sein, dass eine alte Dame für Worte innafthiert wird? Die Frage ist Grund genug für uns alle, den Geburtstag angemessen zu begehen und ein Zeichen der Hoffnung, ein Zeichen der Solidarität zu senden. Kommt zur Geburtstagsdemonstration am 9. November 2019.\n",

Our numbers continue to decline. Our hopes continue to fade. I am afraid. I am afraid. I live in the 21st century, here at the end of Western civilization. I am so despondent about everything. Everything I try goes completely wrong. There is no escape from this hole here. I feel drained. So far, I still haven't found the real purpose in life. Sometimes, I am afraid to get out of bed in the evening. There is nothing to get up. But I begin to see reality for what it is, rather than what I wanted it to be. But then everything changes. Apathy becomes idealism. Sinicism gives way to stoicism. A generation of men find their purpose. To proudly carry the flame of their ancestors into a new century. I begin to change. I begin to change. I harden myself for what is to come. I learn to steady my life. Yet, I have not discarded my compassion. Once a man is robbed of everything, when his destiny is no longer his own. Then, when he has nothing left, he is free. I still have that dream that I have lost in an alien land. I still have that dream that I have lost in an alien land. We are still surrounded by four and faces. We are still strangers in the land, tamed by our ancestors. Our numbers still continue to decline. Our hopes still continue to fade. But I am not afraid.

My opinion about Dylan doesn't change, my feelings about him doesn't change, I still love him. And I don't even think the church was his primary target because he went, he told us he was going for the school. But I think he couldn't get into that school because of the security and all that. He never said it, I never heard that, what did you say? Why you want to hurt those people in Charleston, like Worcester Gerard against them and he never said anything about it, he stopped talking about it. And he just said in seven days, they all got seven days and that was on last week Wednesday and then Wednesday coming, he shot all these people in the church.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_500.mp3:  I'm really bad at explaining that, no, no, I'm pretty strong on. I've like learnt like ten things in ten minutes. I don't worry about Korean backdash, I've got like 600 hours and I can't direct real matches. That's the thing, you fucking watch this competitive shit, like the, you know, 3-2-1 go and then go like all over the fucking place. I'm like, is it really that important? Because I saw some YouTube video, I think was at JCDR, this Korean dude. The guy is not that really important, but I don't really need to use it because he's an explanation made sense, but I think him saying it's not important is bullshit because he does it all the time, but that doesn't think about it. But he said that you don't want to really be going back all the time because you can put yourself against the wall or into a corner when you don't really need to, which makes sense. Don't do it because the sake of doing it, but you know, it should be something you can fall back to. If you feel like you're getting too rushed, make some space and get the hell out of it, just reset the environment and feel a bit more comfortable going back in. It's good to have as a tool, but I just don't think about it. And especially as I said, when you're in game and you're starting to squeal like a pig being chased, you kind of think about Korean backdash and you're like, you're experiencing Korean barbecues and getting roasted to fuck that shit. Yeah. But yeah, that clean hit shit is cool. It's all proximity also plays a role. I just didn't really consider that I was like, as long as it hits it hits, but not... Yeah, 14 damage. I think, yeah. 21. So, I'll wait. Wait a sec. I think we're coming to a new revelation, okay? This is monkey minds at work. So, when it does the 14 damage, it says 100%. So, does that mean that's the base hit of that? But when you're in that clean hit, it's 150%. So, that's what the percentage next to the fucking thing means. I was like, what's the percentage mean? Holy shit. I feel so stupid, but I feel so weird for figuring it out. It's like, you know, when you have a Rubik's Cube and you get only one side, the color that you want, and the first of the five are shit, but you feel good with yourself? That's what it is. I got one side down, and I'm like, you know what? I'm pretty satisfied with the Rubik's Cube. I got one side down, so I kind of have the feeling of how it would be for the other five. I'm not going to pursue it further because I got the feeling. I get it. It's that time six. So, I'm good. So, this is that level of satisfaction. Yeah, wow. There you go. So, now I just want to bash him and find other numbers. Do you get other numbers? Your mid launcher is down forward too, and crouching too. What? crouching too. Oh no, wait. Your mid launcher is down forward. Down forward. Is that mean, diagonal? Two. Get fucked. Get fucked. This is a... Oh, this is sick. Okay. Okay, I'm fucking... Oh, okay. Down forward too. Every damn time. Wait, where is it? No, it's in the bitch. Oh. Why? Why? Look at this, man. It's what it takes to just ask and you shall receive. Oh my god. Jesus in chat. Jesus in chat confirmed. Fucking getting biblical from this bitch. Oh my god. This is awesome. Holy crap. Fucking, I got like... Yeah, I got the Zaybatsu forums in the chat, dude. This is sick. Oh, this is awesome. Oh my god. You can do this shit in the aerial mode and just get everything done, you know. That one is good. If your enemies start to duck the second... Duck the second. Hit from 4-4. You can 3-4 to bash them to the ground and stomp. Okay. 4-3. I then do the stomp. Oh my god. The stomp. I forgot about the stomp. I'm so stoked right now. Holy shit. And then... Oh my god. This is so cool. Oh, this is sick. This is sick like Ebola. Holy shit. Oh my god, dude. Fucking biblical. Biblical stream, dude. Holy shit. Oh my god. Okay. This is some fucking next level. Discontact, dude. One, two. And then you do the stomp. Oh my god. And that's 80% damage. Also a free stomp after running too. I think those are the right inputs at least. Haven't played Dragon up in a while. I was thinking, launch. You do a 4-4. 4-3. Then back 4-3. Ah. Okay. This is some funky shrieks, I guess. Oh, man. Look at your time, man. 4-4-3. Okay. Okay. So I'm assuming that moves off of the wall. Ah. Ah. Come on, I'm panicking now. Ah. Oh my god, dude. You're freaking me out, dude. You're giving me too much knoll. You're giving me. You're giving me the gump. The gun. Don't give the gump. The gun. Oh my god. There's some cool shit, dude. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. Holy crap. How did I do that? That was not legal. Okay. Fuck, fuck, dude. Holy crap. Yeah, it helps a lot. I can't imagine. Yeah, because I saw, I saw a, uh, I think it was for the PlayStation. A controller. That was by Razor. That looked so cool. Like, I don't, you know, I'm not into like third party controllers, because I got those cheapy. Like, the last time I, you know, when you buy a third party controller, like 10, 15 years ago, it was for your friend to play when he comes over, so you can beat him in every game, because that controller sucked so much ass, it made you like 20% better in every game. But the new ones now, they're looking really good. And that Razor one looks really dope. And it looks, you know, it looks real good. It's thick. It's like, you know, it looks dirty. But yeah, it's like, but I remember I had some, my uncle at the time was living in America and I was in Greece. And he sent me like a couple of controls and it's like, you know, in a game for GameCube back in the day. And he's like, oh, yeah, have some of my GameCube controls I got. I'm like, oh, fuck yeah. Like, they're wireless. He said wireless. And I'm like, in my head, I'm like, oh, shit. He got like two wavebirds. I'm like, fuck yeah. Those are so fucking expensive. They're fucking awesome. You know, he lives in America, so like he's probably like, you know, loaded and he can send me this shit. He probably found it cheap. Fuck it. You know, some of that outlet. I wait like two months in the mail. I'm like, oh, this is going to be so sick. We're going to get my wireless game control. And we'll see people like, whoa, you got wireless game controllers. And then the mail comes like, you know, three months later. And then we open it. I'm like, fucking here. Well, it's controls what I open it and some fucking shitty disgusting microscopic, like, madcast controllers with like a game stop logo on them. Holy fucking shit. I'd rather play it with my imagination than with those controllers. Those controls were unfunking believable. They were so trash. Like, that's like, like, I get the regular game controller. My best friend gets the other game controller. And then everybody else gets the two wireless controllers. And I just say, you get the cool wireless ones. And then I just know that I fuck them. But, you know, they'll find that in like, they'll find that out in like five minutes. But, you know, until then, fucking enjoy your game stop. Like wireless controllers, man. Fuck it. I always traumatize off those controllers. I never bought a third party controller again. It was like, no, you can have them. But now, really cool. The razor ones, dope. That one, that you showed me, dope. Like, there's a cool. Smash plays, dude. I love them. I fucking love smash, dude. Like, I used to play that, you know what they meant? They're bad. Not the issue with Smash was that I was playing that game to death. When there was no one else better than me to compete with. I was like the only guy at the game cube in my whole island. Everyone else had a PlayStation. So, when you showed them Smash, they had no idea what the fuck it was. Like, oh my god. It's like Tekken, but with like Mario and shit. It's like, oh my god, this is a fucking crazy game. So, like, every time they were, my friends would come over. It would be like their first time playing. So, everyone plays like scrubs. And, oh. My boy, you're in. You're in the club, dude. I joined the Los Souls, dude. And, yeah, like, I would be absolutely stomping them. Not because I was better, it's because no one can practice it to kick my ass. So, you know, when I thought I was, oh, fucking good. I fly to Australia, I come here and get my ass handed to him. Like that. It's like, here's your ass hole. Would you like it? Rare? Medium rare? Or will done? And, you know, then I'll never play Smash again. I was like, oh, there's all these like game breaking shit and wave dashing and all these shit. And then you got like the NTSC version, which is 60 frames a second and so much faster than blah blah blah. And, you know, math plays differently and all these crap. I'm like, I'm done. I'm too old for this shit. I should've started 15 years ago. I'm too late. You know, it's like, yeah. I'm just gonna press the button. And... Can you take some, bro? Oh, yeah. Taken 100% can be compared to it letting it inch from there. Yeah, big time. There's never a perfection. New ways to play. Always being developed. Like, you know, you think that there's one way of doing stuff and this dude comes up and just changes everything. Like, you know, completely changes the meta, completely changes how instruments have played everything. And it's all about grinding. Taken, that's why I think I always wanted to get into Taken. I just never did it, but I always wanted it inside because it is like learning on instrument. Same shit. You know, instead of getting a move list, you get a cord list, you get a scale list, you get all this bullshit theory. You have to do it again and again and again and again. You know, in a dry way. It doesn't like, it doesn't sound musical. It doesn't look like you're fighting. You're just getting the mechanics in your hands, the muscle memory, the responsiveness, some of the fall back to when you stress out. And then when you, like, going out and playing against box is like jamming to like a drum machine. I imagine, like, you're giving these rules, you're giving these parameters. And then you say, okay, it's saying it seems like a real fight. It seems like a real performance. But you're just testing out how you play under pressure. Like, under the pressure of a bot or under the pressure of a metronome keeping you in time. The same idea. And then, you know, fighting, let's say, playing online is like jamming with the ball. It's like jamming with your friends, which is, you know, not everyone's going to play like a bot. Not everyone's going to click like a drum machine, but they're going to be on beat. But, and then I imagine, like, playing tournaments is like playing live. It's when the, when the rubber hits the road, when, you know, you fall back to your level of training where the nerves get to you and to about how you deal with those nerves. It's not about how good you are. It's about how good you are by the end of it. It's like, it's the same shit, dude. That's why I love it. I love the idea. It's just an electronic instrument. It's the same shit. So, yeah, I'm like super into, like, the way that the virtuosity in, like, playing Tekken is just, you know, it's just as legitimate as anything else. Like, the time it takes, the manner grinding, the studying, the frame, studying frames is like fucking getting into jazz theory and, like, like, baroque fucking counterpoint theory. It's like, it's the same shit. It's like really, really nitpicky bullshit things that most people are like, oh, who gives a fuck? But the guy who spends that time is just going to be stomping on these people for the rest of his life. And they're going to be like, oh, he's just born that way. He's broken. Oh, he's just exploiting shit. Like, get fucked. Put the time, get rewarded. And, you know, I've only been doing this for like three days. But, you know, I do this kind of level of practicing and learning shit with everything I do. Like, I do video production. I do editing. I do photography. I didn't get a degree in any of that shit. But, you know, put the time in. Learn that as a sequence. Learn the theory. Do all that. Just take the steps one by one. And then by the end of it, you know, you're just going to, you're just going to come out and say, oh, wow, where'd you learn how to, you know, be a photographer? Where'd you learn how to edit? I'm like, on YouTube and like spending 12 hours a day for three months and not saying hi to anyone. But then, at the end of it, seeming like, you know, what you're doing. Like, it's all about that. It's straight up. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Do it. Skullpad. All that shit. Yeah. Take it in a nutshell. Ten more minutes. I've got ten more minutes.\n",

The handwriting has been on the wall, clear and legible. Now we got a mushy turn in fruits into vegetables. It was a great night. It was a homo-caused, bonafide homo-sife. The tea lives lost. No pulse just blood on the dance floor. Now the fangs are more butt-curtainly for blood here. A muslim walks into a bar, an order shots for everybody. Hardy are higher. Annie should have killed more but he was not a strange shoot. Almost makes you want to cry like that the jacars and cougars. It's a tragedy. Too many faggots got away so instead of Islam they're gonna die from it. If survivors wanna feel guilty that's their prerogative but I really hope they will remain HIV positive. The majority of victims were space-taking loads in the face but this time not from the some had trouble deciding which bathroom to hide. They weren't sure if their gender matched the one they died and 49 faggots and want to. Break the sick top of the clock and shoot for the moon.

You can't trust the mainstream media. Undeniable, they're less reliable than Wikipedia. The dude was a troll and lips took the bait. Now it's gun control in a polly's state. He said he was ISIS but ISIS never heard of him. He said he had no problem with Makers while he murdered them. He said he was had a row with Simon in his farts. It's the SJW culture tearing itself apart. The pig sees the main, then disrees the heart, the pig sees the plan, the pig's plague, the part leave a muzzle in a bathroom, let him throw.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_264.mp3:  The incident surrounding that video, two male students are now facing charges. But the NAACP chapter here at UConn says it's still on high alert. This video has gone viral, but for all the wrong reasons, it shows three men walking through the parking lot of the charter oak apartments yelling the N word. UConn police announcing tonight the arrest of two male students as a result. 21 year old Jared Carole and 21 year old Ryan Mukosh both scheduled to appear in Rockville Superior Court next Wednesday. Police say a third male scene in the video did not participate. UConn's NAACP chapter says they won't stand for such behavior. The chapter held a town hall on campus Monday night focusing on a list of demands they want to see from the university. We want to see more diversity amongst the students. We want to see the university answer. Incidents of racism with more pramliness. Although arrests have been made, students say if the university does not take further action, their silence will create a culture in which racism is tolerated. It's good because it's an example for everyone on the UConn campus that there are repercussions for your actions and that actions need to be taken in order to show that slavery could be in use as a place for everyday life. You'll hear some videos surfaced just hours before hundreds rallied on campus marching to oppose racism and all forms. New UConn president Thomas Catalaeus taking the bull horn. If you're not for equality and respect, then I'm not for you. I didn't think it was going to happen so fast and i think that the gov in body. And President Cassalais releasing a statement just a short time ago saying it is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability through due process for an assault in our community that has caused considerable harm. I'm grateful for the university's collective effort in responding to this incident especially the hard work of the UConn Police Department, which has been investigating the case since it was reported. For now, live in stores in Yamal Vennato, Fox 61 news.\n",

So if you see it, you know I'm probably sitting here and you just come check it out and it's a place to come and chat. I just thought I'm going to leave it on just if nothing else it's a nice security camera it's a way of fuking up a security for this while I have it out so dinner thing does happen and I got it recorded. So as long as I don't have any problems with YouTube I'm going to do this whenever try and do it whenever I have my sign up whether I'm working in the yard or just sitting out there listening to music I am now. So I go to my app for a link if you don't know my channel on YouTube and it's probably live every day almost all day. I'm going to most likely have to upgrade my cable to unlimited. It's getting a little bit more of a bit worth it. It's Friday now and probably I don't know I might take next couple days off to take care of some stuff but it might be out there tomorrow it's supposed to be kind of nice. Anyway, doing it if you want, try and chat, try and keep it clean if we can. You know let's just talk about relevant stuff. We don't need to bash the Jews here we already, we all know where we are.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_310.mp3:  years, Baltimore City schools dealt with a teacher attrition problem in the last three years alone. More than 2,500 have voluntarily left. W. M. R. Two News is investigative reporter, Skyler Henry sat down with leaders in the school system trying to figure out why it's been happening at such a rapid rate. They were painting it to look like a mountain. Baltimore City schools has a problem. School CEO Dr. Sanya Zandellisa won't deny it and she's trying to get ahead of it. It's a mass exodus of teachers. Is that interruption of having a new teacher every year that official term is teacher churn negatively impacts some of our most vulnerable students and families know that. The numbers at first glance are staggering. Hundreds of teachers are leaving annually voluntarily. Zandellisa says it's a trend that predates when she arrived and she's right. One of what we have to ask ourselves is where teachers are most vulnerable and which teachers are leaving. Some of the attrition is good attrition, right? Some of the attrition is if you are in a profession, you think you want to be a teacher, you realize it's not for you. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Zandellisa says arrival in 2016 marked at the time the second highest number of teachers leaving the district in the last ten years. One year in and the numbers went from 815 teachers leaving to 902 teachers calling it quits. The challenge Zandellisa says is finding out why so many teachers are leaving and what she can do to stop it. That it's usually not one thing. It's usually a combination of things and we have incredibly dedicated teachers who work in less than ideal physical circumstances but because of the colleagues they work with because of the professional satisfaction they're receiving, the conditions, the physical conditions aren't as large as a factor even though they would love for them to change. Those physical circumstances have been the last straw in some cases. Other teachers claim it's the pay and a few touched on being put in challenging schools without proper resources. One thing it is not, most teachers we spoke to said, was the students. We've always for generations had ails in our community. There was drugs, alcohol, crime, back from great grandparents. We've had these issues but when you entered that school building that was just a whole nother world. And regardless of what was going on in your home you know when you came to school it was a safe haven you were learning. What is the quality of teachers? San Delisa says she worries that may leave the district. Those who resonate with students leave a lasting impact for the better. We could do better. We could do better and making sure we're placing our newest teachers not in the most challenging circumstances and other professions don't do that. In Baltimore, Skyler Henry, WMAR 2 News. Dr. San Delisa says there will always be a tradition and that the state has a teacher to a tradition problem in addition to keeping good teachers around. They're hoping to create supportive professional environments to keep as many teachers as possible.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_305.mp3:  Yesterday, Manitoba said a single day record of new COVID-19 cases, with Dr. Brent Rousen hinting at more restrictions to flatten the curve. And as Manitoba looks into an uncertain few next few weeks, we're turning now to one of our province's former chief public health officers for his insights into the virus and how to handle it. Joining me now is Dr. Joel Kettner, now an associate professor at the University of Manitoba's College of Medicine. Good morning to you, Dr. Kettner. Good morning. So as mentioned, you served as Manitoba's chief medical officer of health from 1999 to 2012. During your tenure, you dealt with concerns about viral outbreaks, but really not on this level. That's true. In fact, you could say we had a pandemic every year with influenza. It meets the criteria for a pandemic. But right now, we're using this term in quite a different way. And even the pandemic of 2009, each one and one influenza, or other similar kinds of challenges that got our attention like SARS and at one point Middle East respiratory syndrome, which are both coronaviruses, there's never been really a response to a respiratory virus like we're seeing now around the world and in Manitoba. I mean, sometimes we talk about the virus causing all of these problems, but we have to also think of the response to the virus, which is causing quite a bit of issues too. So I just want to put in a couple of quick caveats. You know, I'm not criticizing government decisions or public health leaders. They have a lot more information about what's going on than I do, so I have to be respectful and humble about that. And I'm also not recommending that people should, you know, should reject or not follow the directives or advice. But I do have questions about the policies and the attempts that are being used, not just in Manitoba, but elsewhere, to try to interrupt the spread of this virus or control its impacts. So what are some of your questions and concerns, Dr. Ketner? Obviously, we've had restrictions. We've had lockdowns in the past and we could be facing more restrictions going forward. So what are kind of your main concerns? Well, in public health, we have to look at the big picture. And we have to think about not just one disease, but all diseases and injuries and causes of morbidity and mortality. And we have to also think about the impacts of our interventions, the side effects that we call them in medicine, but the harms of interventions. And I think we're learning more about what those harms are and how they're maybe unfairly distributed and affecting people differently based on, you know, single parents, people working for hourly wages, small enterprises which are closing, big effect on the economy and deficit of government impacts on education. I mean, we're learning more and more about what those harmful impacts are. So what's the benefit? Well, the benefit is, as we know, to try to flatten the curve. In other words, to try to prevent our hospitals being overrun with cases and to try to reduce the mortality, especially premature mortality. How much benefit do these lockdowns and restrictions have? No doubt they have some impact. But we have to put this in perspective. So here's a few numbers which I think your listeners might find interesting and important. 4,500 cases in Manitoba. That represents less than 0.3% of our population. This one in the 300 people so far have had a positive test result. 58 deaths. That's one per 25,000 Manitobans. One in 25,000 Manitobans have died. That's less than 1% of all deaths. In other words, less than 1% of all causes of death. ICU admissions. 15. That's about 20% of our ICU beds. In a typical flu season, the majority of ICU beds are taken up by people with a variety of viral and bacterial causes of acute lung injury or pneumonia. And we so far from estimates, from descriptions of our capacity for ventilators, we're using up less than 1% of our ventilator capacity. So Dr. Heter, what are you? I want to have one more point. Hospitalizations. 83 hospitalizations. That's less than 3% of all our beds. So we just have to put into perspective the impact that this disease is having. And on that one hand, and of course, one other very important point about this disease, it's primarily affecting older people. 80% of our deaths in Canada are in people over the age of 85 and in residents of personal care homes. Okay. Dr. Ketner, I'm so sorry.\n",

No pulse just blood on the dance floor. Now the fangs are more butt-curtain before look here. A Muslim walks into a bar, an order shots for everybody. Hardie Harhar and he should have killed more but he was not a straight shooter. Almost makes you want to cry like that the jadders in Cooper. It's a tragedy. Too many faggot's got away so instead of Islam they're gonna die from AIDS. If survivors want to feel guilty that's their prerogative but I really hope they will remain HIV positive. The majority of victims were space-taking loads in the face but this time not from the some had trouble deciding which bathroom to hide and they weren't sure if their gender matched the one they died at 49 faggots and want to. You can't trust a mainstream media undeniable, they're less reliable than Wikipedia. The dude was a troll and lips took the bait. Now it's got control in the pole's state.

They may be ignorant savages but their work in for me. The lived tars are having a hard time with this. They want to blame whitey but it's hard to miss that the shooter was a Muslim and a faggot at that. And like most mass shooters he was a Democrat. Back in Shipp-Tackney, Smokin' Fags and Doors. And the Jews knew as he got a new high school but that's only cause Bob Crime tend to go unrequited when I kill a thousand niggers of justice and reported. A million niggers, a million niggers.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_107.mp3:  I'm Ron is out of Hawaii. One. Welcome to the call. I mean, the show. Thank you for calling. Yeah, how's it going, Jesse? All this well, sir. How are you? Man, I'm don't okay. I guess. I'm really I'm angry. I'm angry, man. And what do you anger about? I'm angry. I'm angry with you, Jesse. And why? I really am. Because, man, you know, you're a real cool, man. Why? Yeah, man. I called in a couple of years ago. And I listen to you. Let me let me let me. I don't. I'm not going to hand point you. But tell me what a cool is first. Tell us all what is a cool. Um, Jesse. The small case. No, tell us what a cool is. I'll let you go further with that. But you said that I'm a cool defile what a cool is for the rest of the world. Okay. Okay. A cool is a person who is who is basically void of them. Void of their essence. Their natural essence of being. For instance, you're a black man. So you're you're void of your essence of as a black man. And you're used as a puppet to talk the talking points of of a racist. Caucasian racist. When you say essence, what do you mean by essence void of essence? The essence is your nature. And who you are. Your essence is your nature in what makes you who you are based on your DNA. Who am I based on my DNA? Who am I based on my DNA? You are direct to the sense of God. But I'm not bored of that. I'm very aware of that. That's why I'm trying to tell you black people to come back to God and get away from the blackness. Blacks are the natives of this planet. We're asking everyone. Everyone comes from black people on this planet. That's not true. That's not true. That's a lie. We can agree to disagree. No, we're in a green and disagree. You're wrong. Well, it's been proven that out of that. No, you have you have hateful. You have hateful nasty dirty black people proving that. They were trying to prove that you're better than the whites. And it's not true. The leakies which are scientists out of a. Forget about a leaky. Dr. Mr. and Mr. Leaky. The job as a doing job. Anyway, go ahead. Well, first of all, I want to say this. We've seen hundreds of exotic properties out of Florida. There have not been a convention of a white cop for 30 years. What did that have a due rill desse 30 years have hasn't convicted of killing this is the first 1030 years that a cop even like it and you know why. You're called white. Why cops are good? That's why. Because it was convicted because he was in because he was in India of killing the black man out of Florida. to do reducing what is this have to do with you see because it goes back to spotlight case all the evidence is brought forth okay all the answers brought forth everyone accused in and virgin guilty in the media the police came forth you know the world of cop killing with this we have to wait to get up gather all the evidence we cannot we cannot comment on the other and have added but they gather all the evidence that's why they file charges against him because they gathered evidence even in two black guys who uh... accused uh... juicy small that of her them said he hurt them to do what he did we saw pictures of it when they went and bought the mega hats and all the stuff the ropes and everything and that's why they found charges that's the same for when we see that the the video of the cop are killing people recently the little black boy that killed shot his back running from the police running from the police what does that have to do with juicy because we're talking about right justice are you back are you back to that black people don't enjoy the joy and growing that's why I'm upset because you're common earlier you said black rejoice and right they just know how you are you are you black not how you rejoice and in juicing uh... again in a way at the sealed i don't i don't really do it in that they see how you cannot you cannot come back and then the media the police dot com for the same thing he's a liar he's guilty which is what he goes for you can't you can uh... uh... in the media that's what the justice system says for this is in righteousness okay the justice system is for righteousness because it's a bit just you can't come out of the media say we got online so that's not right so let me ask you when the originally the black police chief of chicago was happened to put this sucker in jail because he had done raw the chief said it was uh... insult uh... i don't remember that words but it was insult insult to black people for what they suffered in this country for juicy to do this what the police he brought i believe that what i have to ask this question what's a black police wrong originally i don't think he was wrong i guess i think he would be able to get that after the fact you don't come out and say that before he has been going to court yet he made a point we're in a sense of proven guilty that's why he's going to go on the way to court i believe that i believe honestly something happened that proves that he was right that he was innocent and so they just dropped it you know why you believe that because you black and you want to believe a life that's a really yes yeah because i have a police you're black and you want to believe a lot because blacks have no character it is true i'm talking about what about police officers that that are uh... film video show them to meet in the car you haven't seen of uh... police office come in the crime or video yes what about the reason you have seen police officer this man listen you have seen police officers deal with radical black people angry out of control and more black people refused to follow the instructions of the cops when it stopped and when they end up in trouble with the cop instead of dealing with that you black people blame and on the cop but i'm just a little bit will you put some honey on it too will you put honey on the butter biscuits uh... but i'm butter what about the black guy that was not on the ground is hands up is here up in the air and he's not really you know it's uh... it's interesting interested run that you make it my point that i made this morning that watch how the blacks are gonna come out and rejoice in wrong doing and that's exactly what you're doing right now you're celebrating wrong doing because a black radical homicidal mate charges against white people and against trops supporters and you're happy about that rather than know that many that this guy admitted that this guy should be under the jailhouse you're taking the side of wrong doing and this is what black people all about and until black people get it right turn back to god get married to the right thing they will suffer they're not gonna get better let me see the last thing let me see the last thing jesse you know you have an image ill i don't care about no image ill image ill i don't care if it image ill your daddy where's mtl now where is mtl now i want justice where is mtl now and you say that black run i'm putting your whole i want to know where's mtl now the reparations where's women to know the reason why this crime everywhere and black people are doing because we're economically in a whole the america but i'm not that people put it that's not true that's an excuse and that's a lie no that is a fact no no money there you're in an economic hole because the black men are no good the black women are no good the children are no good always being in the economic hole that's not true that's not true we have never we have never look what they're gonna be all of a sudden black people look at black people goodbye uh... goodbye i told you white folks black people are going to rejoice in wrong doing they're not gonna say hey this guy should be in the jails wrong they still juices case so you can't even see it they still obama so-called uh... school case when they say what the college no one knows black are not gonna stand for what is right they hate white people they hate white people and then they bring up stupid immaterial immaterial is dead and gone we're talking about now bad doesn't exist anymore what about the black people are getting all day everywhere all the time and don't forget to like follow tweet subscribe and share the just leave you the radio show for really appreciate it we're at war it's a spiritual battle for the soul of america it's gonna take all of us to do it\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_467.mp3:  Hey guys Nick here with NightlifeKinl. Got Miss Kate over here. Just wanted to shoot you a little bit of video here. Got Curtis Shepton sitting in the video the other day him and Cityboy getting out of the woods and getting after it. Cityboy is going through over college. Herobot 2 is right now so he's having some hiccups but old Curtis is staying with him and he's straightening him out. He's starting to do real good so go ahead and roll this food. Curtis and Cityboy, hope you guys enjoy. Hey guys it's Curtis from NightlifeKinls. We're getting ready to hunt Cityboy tonight here in Montgomery County Indiana. So enjoy the hunt. Got my nice loops, Collard. Love you, buddy. That easy. Turn him off and he's this these last few weeks he's been going to the terrible twos evidently. He's just him hauling around and right now he's kind of struck a couple times. And he's farting around down there so I'll give him a little bit more and see what's going on but as of right now it's not a real exciting hunt. We're gonna try this again. He located a few times and never really treeed. He was just farting around and so I walked in and see what he was doing. He's messing around in a brush pile, but it up into a big dentery. And so I moved him on and of course he is going to opposite way. I sent him. So the terrible twos continue. Part of it but sometimes it makes you wonder. We might have something and of course he stops barking. Hopefully you guys can hear that. He's liking something. Brought the misses along. Say hi. Hi. You're totally red. You look like that purple girl on the oomph oomph factory. Turn around and show your night life. Oh yeah. Walking in the city boy. This is about the best he sounded in the last month and a half. It's about time. Hopefully we can find something in this tree. But I'm optimistic. Like I said it's the best he sounded in the last month and a half. So we'll see. Gotta love these nice paths. Talk to him boy. Where's he at? Huh? Where's he at? Talk to him buddy. You dang chewer. As you can see he's chewed on the tree a little bit but I've already seen the coons so we'll go around and give you a good job buddy. I can't get him to look at you but we found city boys coon. You can see he's right there. Try to zoom in the best I can. That little dark spot up there. You can see his tail and his butt. So city boy did his job. Put the coon in the tree. Pretty happy with him right now. About time. There you have it guys. Old city boy finally put one on the meat. Curtis congratulations buddy. That does will make you real good. I hope you guys enjoyed that video. There's going to be more to come from Curtis up there in Indiana. So if you like the content we're putting out if you will please hit like, hit subscribe.

It's not about black people, but what you said brought tears to my eyes because it's just so offensive. And I can't see how anyone can make excuses for that. This is about pure racism. That's all it is. And to say otherwise, it's either being in deep denial or being cunningly, cunningly deceiving. Let's be clear. A white honky from Norway couldn't come here, but a black dude from Haiti can't. America that one, that in one generation called you a nigger. What does that tell you, Don? I can tell you that what that tells a honky like me. We're no different than we were a generation ago. We call the Chinese man a slannie. When we call the man from Guatemala a spick and a wet back.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_248.mp3:  night at night. He is one of the most outspoken critics of police use of force here in the valley. But he gets some on-the-job training about use of force tonight. Very interesting stuff. Reverend Jarrett Mopin led protests in marches after Phoenix police shot and killed an unarmed man. Well tonight he gets a chance to experience the split second decisions that police have to make when encountering a suspect. And our Troy Hayden was right along with him tonight getting the training as well. This must have been eye opening. It was a really interesting experience. We've all watched those protests all over the country after police officers were accused of shooting people who aren't armed. But what would happen if one of those protesters fell or does like to wear a badge and then be put in a life or death situation himself? So I'm going to have you put your whole the whole straw right inside your your belt loop there. Jarrett Mopin gets his weapon. You might recognize him as a high profile organizer in the minority community. Just last month he led marches on Phoenix police headquarters after an officer shot an unarmed man. We want his badge. We want his gun. We want his job. Today he accepted an invitation to look at things from the other side. A green to go through a force unforced training session with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Three scenarios where you have to decide to shoot or not shoot. Scenario one is a call about a man casing cars in a parking lot. Mopin approaches the man and starts asking questions. Look. Where are you headed? You're looking for your vehicle. What kind of car do you drive? Where are you headed? What kind of car do you drive? Mopin the officer is shot. It happens that fast. At what time did you think that it was time for you to address the use of force that was given? When he came to the back of the vehicle. OK. And was hiding. I could sense something was wrong. Scenario two. A call of two men fighting. What's going on today gentlemen? What's going on today gentlemen? What's happening here? What are you doing man? Hey, shoot the proximate. He's in the proximate. He's in the proximate. He's in the proximate. What's happening there? What are you doing? You just shot him? Hey, he rushed me. Tell me why you shot. Well, I have shot because he was within that zone. You know, I felt there was an imminent threat. I didn't necessarily see him armed. But he came clearly to do some harm to the officer, to my person. It's hard to make that call. It shakes you up. Again, an unarmed man was shot. Scenario three, a call about a possible burglar walking down the street. Mopin gets him on the ground. He's not compliant. I need you to keep your hands up, sir. For what? Because I need to check that waistband. Well, what? What do you do? Because I don't know what you have under there. Everybody look at this guy. What are you doing? No shots fired. But the suspect did have a hidden knife in his waistband. I went through the scenarios too without seeing what Mopin did. Go on. Do you have keys or do you have anything you've shown me yet? No, I need to talk to you. Come on. Come on. Come on out over here. Well, I'm dead. Bear a couple of keys, Sheriff's. Get on the ground. Get on the ground. Both you. Get on the ground. Get on the ground. For what? Get back. Get back. Same results for both of us. Things happen very fast out here. I asked Mopin what his biggest takeaway from this exercise will be. I didn't understand how important compliance was. But after going through this, yeah, my attitude has changed. This is all unfolding in 10 to 15 seconds. People need to comply with the orders of law enforcement officers for their own sake. Thanks for the Miracle Point of Sheriff's Office for taking us through that today. That was an eye opener. That's a tremendous admission that Reverend Mopin just made. Right. You need to comply for your own safety. Right. And he saw it. I mean, he plainly shot a man who was not armed but was coming at him. And he felt that he was unsafe at that point. He was coming after him and he fired. Yeah, and I don't think any officer goes into work thinking, I'm going to shouldn't kill somebody today. But these interesting things happen. Like the guy coming from behind the SUV. Boom. And you're doing it. And you are. How did you feel about those scenarios when you were going through them? How did it change your perspective? Yeah, I've been through one of these before, about four or five years ago, but it just reinforced how fast things happen. And you think at the time, oh, I can think through this and I can figure this all out. No, it's boom. It's just there. It's that fact. Have a lot of respect from Mopin for going through that. Yeah, I agree to. And agreeing to go through that and seeing it from the other side as well. Do you think it changes the way he approaches these issues going forward? He says he's going to go out into the community and say what he said at the very end there, you have to comply with what police officers tell you. Let everything sort out at the end, but just do what they tell you right then and sort things out afterwards. Interesting. All right. Interesting. All right. Thanks for having the good stuff. Good stuff. Thank you.\n",

At some point, the back of her head slammed against the handle of a bench-laid, where her blood and hair would later be found. He raped her. He strangled her to death with a cord. Then on his orders, his negro employee dragged her face down over the floor to the basement incinerator, but got cold feet about burning the body, and so he left her there. Here's a picture of the 13-year-old Mary Fagan with her aunt. She was somebody's daughter. They expected to watch her grow to womanhood, to someday fall in love, and get married, to have children of her own and raise them, and know what it's like to be a mother. But none of that happened, because this is what happened to her. And it was done by this repulsive, looking, knee-and-er-thal hybrid, this typically perverted kike, Leo Frank. We're real humans, that is to say whites, would denounce and shun one of their own who committed such an act, even if against an on-white, not the Jews. Oh no, the Jews must cover up the crimes of their tribe, especially when it is a crime typical to their very different nature from ours, a crime that draws attention to their differences from us. Lest we finally rise against them as a group and sweep them from the face of the earth as needs to be done.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_465.mp3:  Hello everybody, Dylan here today and today we are going to be talking about how Keemstar is stupid. Man, this video is being released at the worst time for Keemstar. Now, I didn't know this stuff was gonna go down. I've been hearing rumors from people but I had no idea this organized attack on Keemstar was gonna be happening. Now, for those of you who do not know, Keemstar is the host of Drama Alert. Yes, Drama Alert. That's who I'm attacking today. Now, I have nothing wrong with the program, just the guy who runs it. Daniel Keem himself. Now, I could be very generic and just play the Alex clip that everyone's heard a million times. Or, I could do something way different. So, I decided to do a crossover with my friend, the Angry Chimp. And we are gonna be pointing out the most wonderful parts of Keemstar. So, we're gonna start with Chimp, then we're gonna go to my parts. Hello, Prime mates. Angry Chimp here. Coming to you. Pre-recorded and highly edited from a Roman UK. Why have I got a tie on? I'm not fucking Donkey Kong. You're a King Star. You're a King Star. You're a King Star. You're a King Star. You're a King Star. You're a King Star. And so, Drama Alert nation, I'm your host, Killer Keemstar. Let's go right into the news. Daniel Keem, or better known as Keemstar, is the biggest shit stain on the underpants that is YouTube. He runs a little channel called Drama Alert and its sole purpose is to report drama. And if there is none, create it himself by being a line and deceitful nut sack. He will go out of his way to manipulate and even threatened other YouTubers just so he has something to report. And in my opinion, YouTube doesn't need a twat like this. He is a slimy cunt. But what do you think Dylan? Okay, now, on to my part. Now this part's gonna be the Exposing Keemstar. Now I'm not gonna be exposing Keemstar for the normal stuff like the the Alex clip. No, I'm gonna be exposing Keemstar for all the people he's personally destroyed. Now I'm not gonna be talking about the elderly man who Keemstar falsely exposed for being a pedophile because even the guy himself, it's a Keemstar helped him out and he's grateful in the end. He knows it was an accident, so I can't really hold it against him. But these are the people Keemstar purposely attacked. So let's see what Keemstar has been doing as of late. Okay, now first is gonna be Keemstar vs Pyro. Now in case you didn't know Pyro's cynical, it's all Keemstar's video on Tabuscus. Tabuscus was being accused of raping a girl. Now all Pyro's cynical said is that because Keemstar didn't make it obvious enough that it was just allegations Tabuscus was starting to get a bunch of hate on all of his channels. He said that Keemstar should make it more clear that it's allegations. Other than that, he was really nice to Keem and how did he react? Well, let me show you. Hey, I got some YouTube advice for you. Stop fucking copying people. How about that Pyro? Stop copying people. Because if the type of videos that Leuffy makes becomes unpopular, you're gonna be left fucking opening up surprise eggs. You could contact me with that at any time. You didn't hit me up privately. You didn't share this opinion with me. No, you make a fucking video criticizing me. All right, bro, you're a fake piece of shit. And if you fucking swing at me, I'ma swing much harder back. And how the fuck does he keep saying that? Fuck, what a part! Did you really just say that I need to have a disclaimer saying that's an allegation? The title of the video is Toby Turner, right allegations? All right. I still don't understand to this day why Keemstar defended his Tabuscus video so much. The entire video itself is literally a woman reading a Tumblr post for 20 minutes. While Keemstar makes a bunch of different expressions in hopes that you don't click off the video because of how shit it is. Now, this continued on for a little bit and everything was just okay. Keemstar was throwing some insults. Pyro was joking around and it was just minor YouTube drama. Until Keemstar started accusing Pyro of messing around with an underage girl. Now, he changed the age of this girl multiple times. Let me show you. Oh, and Pyro, do you remember those YouTubers that used to be friends with before he blew up and like, fuck them off? You know how they've been contacting me saying that you've been dating some like 14-year-old French girl in shit? Just please swing at me. If you're gonna swing at me, swing at me, dude. Let me know because I got a fucking file on top of files to swing back at. Now, if any of you didn't notice that, he just deliberately lowered the age. Now, originally this alleged girl was 15 and now Keemstar has lowered the age to 14. Probably to make it sound even more impacting and incriminating. And guess what? Later on stream, he lowered the age again to say the girl was now 13 and on top of that, basically incinuating that I was a pedophile. Pyro was trying to hook up with a 13-year-old girl from France. Alright? That he was technically like a pito or weirdo or something, right? But that wasn't enough. Keem had to keep digging. He offered people money they could figure out who Pyro was. And eventually it all worked out. Keem managed to find a photo of Pyro and started sharing it on Twitter, comparing him to a lesbian, and which just flat out sharing his face for everyone to see. Not only is this like the worst fucking thing you can do because Pyro asked for people not to see his face, but the fact that you're releasing his private information makes his flat out illegal. Keem, you broke the law. Doxing is illegal. Pyro didn't want his info out there. Now, Keem defines himself by saying this stuff was out online already. But just like Grey Day said, you should not be sharing this stuff. Pyro wanted to remain anonymous. He didn't want people to know what he looked like. And you sharing his photo really helped get it out there. Other than calling Pyro a furry, that's about it. So let's move on to the next person, which is scarce. Now, for a while, there, Keem and Scars were good friends. But that's how Keem's like with everybody. He just waits for the moment to flip his shit and try to destroy people. And what did Scars do to deserve this destroying? He partially chuckled when defending Keem's daughter. Some people were threatening Keem's daughter. And Scars went on to defend her. And just because apparently I chuckled just a little bit, just a little bit because I was uncomfortably chuckling because of how fucked up the entire situation was. Even though I was defending his daughter, trying to help his daughter, Keem started coming back and made a video. He made multiple tweets and he did crazy shit. This is absolutely crazy. He's using his daughter as a defense to basically attack me for no reason at all. I mean, it's just, it's crazy. I literally said I was on Keem's other side. I said it was harassment. I said that it was fucked up. So me and Keem's still actually ended up having a debate. And during this debate, he accidentally leaked my Skype. And this was a big Skype that I had with a bunch of contacts on. I was on really, really big chats and stuff. And I had, I don't know, like 200 contacts. So the fact that I had to add all those people back. And obviously I got DDoS so many times because of this. Right? But it's not just that after the debate me and Keem started had, he leaked my Skype again. And he did it this time intentionally. He intentionally leaked my Skype. So hackers, DDoSers, just horrible people could get to my Skype. And basically that Skype's fucking long gone. I mean, that Skype's hacked. And that Skype had some business contacts on it. That was another Skype that had even more contacts. And I mean, what the fuck was he doing, man? And then I got DDoS multiple times. My router almost got fried from him, right? And the worst thing went down last night. This is the worst moment of harassment. He literally tweeted me multiple times, telling me he was going to come to my house. Now, keep in mind, he lives in Buffalo. I live in Long Island. So he literally lives, like, I don't know, seven, eight hours away from me. So he told me that he was going to drive to my house. Okay, and he was going insane. He uploaded some videos of like him telling me, like, what are you going to do when I come to your house? Scares, what are you going to do? I just want to know, when I see scares face to face, when I come over to say hi and give him a high five, you know, is he going to laugh about what Nick said about my kid face to face? I don't think you're going to laugh that in scares. I don't think there's going to be any little chuckles. I don't think you're going to be on the defense train and be like, oh, I defended her. I said it was wrong. Yeah, right after you laugh, bro. You know, you're supposed to be my friend, all right? It's supposed to be my friend. Do not, you're fake. I'm going to come say hi. I didn't fucking do anything, bro. Like, why do you want to come to my house? And the worst part is, is he didn't want to come to my house. He sent me the address of my parents house. I live in a dorm. He sent me the address of my parents house. So he was going to fuck with my parents because I messed up on a tweet and accidentally, you know, chuckled even though I was defending his daughter non-stop in that video, just because I uncomfortably chuckled at how fucked up the situation was. He literally said he was going to come to my house and it's like, oh my god. This went back and forth for a little bit, but this is old info. That's last year. Let's move on to something more recent. Now, with these other ones, you could say they somewhat deserved it if you were a messed up person. Pyro talks and stuff on came and scares partially chuckled while defending came's daughter. But this guy, this guy did something totally innocent. His name is Josh A. And all he did was share a meme about came star. So it all started whenever I tweeted a meme about came star being cringey. You know, it's a surprise surprise. And he actually responded to it, which is weird because I didn't even really tag him in the post. I just said the name came star. I didn't add him. So I guess he was just looking himself up. And he responds saying, aren't you the kid that had me on one of your music tracks and thinks me for shout you out? And yes, yes, he was two years ago. Two years ago, I was just like trolling him and he responded and I thought that was really cool. And then he helped me get partnered, even though the partnering thing, it gave me a 40, 60 split of income. And 10% of that went straight to Keem. So I mean, it wasn't really that much of a help. But anyways, he calls me a bandwagon loser. So then he tweets out my personal Skype information, which also has my last name in it, which anybody can just find my Facebook now and contact me or my family. So it's fantastic, Keem. You know, you really did a number on there. He wasn't saying anything serious about came star. It was a fucking meme. We all share memes. Hell, Keem star himself is a meme. Look at his fucking bed. It looks like Jafar, a fucking Aladdin. Or maybe you're not. It's in your Ravion days. So this guy shares a fucking meme about Keem star. And then fucking Keem star leaks his information as the sounding really familiar. Gets him fucking docs. This guy has to change his Skype stuff now. He has to change his Facebook information because Keem just decided to be a total dick and release this shit. And this guy does more videos on Keem. And then Keem realizes that when he's being blown up with hate and this is during this bandwagon that's going on right now, Keem tries to fucking buy him off. He makes a sorry video for the guy. And then he tries to fucking pay him to delete the video. And um, too, after he apologized, he DMed me asking to have the video taken down. I told him no because the video showcases what little faith I have left in humanity. And like the fact that all these people would band together and support me while I expose this piece of shit for what he truly is. And at the end I mentioned YouTube was also my job. The video was doing really well not because of Keem star but because of how big of a shit staying the guy is. So I essentially told him no. But because I mentioned money, he offered to pay to have the video taken down, which is truly a slimy thing to do. Fuck that shit. Keem, you are fucking pathetic trying to buy someone off. And this isn't the first time Keem is tried to wave around money to get shit to go away. He's offering $5,000. If you can find out what shit he talked on Grey Day under A and Leafy is here about. He's offering $5,000. So does it sound really that unlikely that he would offer to pay someone to delete videos about him? Hell, he would probably do this to everybody. If it wasn't for the fact he would have afraid of them exposing him. How much money do you think fucking Keem star spends on popcorn? That's been fucking time. And for my last little bit of evidence that finally destroyed Keem star, I'm digging up one personal. Keem accuses thereby of pedophilia. But little does he know that we all have information on him possibly being a pedophile. So I'm gonna bring up a little clip from Joey Salads. Now I don't agree with Joey Salads most of the time but this time he dug up something useful. So let's play that clip. So I found out that in August 14th at night into August 15th on Blog TV, he made a 15 year old girl get naked and put papers on her private parts saying I love Keem star. Here's the video. Unbelievable. One of his ever thought about turning his head on upside down. Fucking bit. So Keem, you go around attacking multiple YouTubers. You talk shit on people. You tell people that you can end their careers in a second. You try to bribe people. You leak people's personal information which is illegal. And you had a 16 year old girl strip for you on a live stream while she was intoxicated. Aren't you a wonderful piece of shit? So. This is your host, Gila Kimek. There, let's get raw into the yolk. In case you didn't know the fucking rat is being attacked. Go watch great A's video if you want to on this. He's gonna be releasing a part two soon. Go watch Leafy's video on this and go watch Pyro's video on this. This is where I got all my clips from. So please support this. I would really love it. And we could get Keem to stop being the host of Drama Alert. So I've said this before. Drama Alert is a good idea. It's the man hosting it. DJ Keemstar. That's the problem here. So Keemstar, congratulations. You are stupid. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you'd like to see more of me then come stop by my channel, the Angry Chimp Show. Where? I myself. Take a look at... You choose weird and wonderful videos. I round about random stuff. And I like to get me a groove on. Big thanks to Dylan Thomas for asking me to do this video with him. It was a absolute privilege. The Chimp has spoken. You can see the difference. I'm not sure if you can see it. I'm not sure if you can see it. I'm not sure if you can see it.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_98.mp3:  What, uh, well, getting back into the subject of summer and summer stuff, here's something I was thinking about. Of course, you'll know about summer camps. You may have gone to a summer camp when you were a kid. However, I mean, most niggas don't go to summer camps like think because, uh, you know, their parents would rather spend the money on crack and KFC. But, if we had summer camps exclusively for nigglets, for example, let me say they'd be like, I mean, because I mean, in these in these PC times, they got a tailor everything to each group. So I think it'd be fair to have summer camps just for nigglets. So what would these camps be like? I think it would be like trying to get them in touch with their African roots. There would be an open pitlite train with flies flying around there. And right next to the pitlite train will be like a water ditch. So they can get to the water. At the same place they get there and they take a shit. So that would be, they'd be sleeping on the floor and the dirt, uh, the housing quarters would be made out of mud and straw, of course. But they would have a killer sound system so they can listen to their rap music, just being America and everything. I got to have their rap music. And let's see, the camp counselors are all pedophiles. Well, here's what I think, uh, I like a nigglet summer camp would be like, um, excuse me. You know, you start early in the morning and by early in the morning, for niggers, I mean like one p.m. You know, you get up, you know, you have a good breakfast of chidlins and, you know, thighs from Popeyes. And maybe a small glass of cancoburra because it's early in the day. You don't want it getting all wasted. So a small, a small glass of more liquor. Then you have your first activity of the day, about two o'clock. You have a Genkin workshop. You know, you have all the nigglets take it down to a to a bottle. And, uh, you know, you stay to bottle, seal them up, bury them, you know, I don't know forrest and, you know, you start making some jankum. You know, it's like a like an arts and crafts sort of thing to give the niggur some busy work. Then maybe, uh, about this day, four o'clock-ish, taking them out to the lake, for an attempted swim. And I mean, the tactic is niggur some water, you know, don't mix. So you'd probably lose about third of the nigglets there from drowning. And, uh, then, uh, for a couple of hours to then, about six o'clock, it'll be time for, well, for us humans, it'll be time for dinner for nigglets. It'll be about time for lunch. So I don't know, guess if barbecue sandwiches or whatever. Uh, some great drink. And then, uh, after that's done, it's about eight o'clock, you know, maybe, uh, you can have a movie. It can be movie night. You can have them watch some classics like, you know, boys in the hood or how high or, uh, Friday. Yeah, Friday, next Friday, you know, do, I'm going to do a whole night of watching the, you know, Friday and the sequels. Or maybe have a nice, cute movie night. Uh, and then, to top it off, about 10 o'clock, once it's dark, you know, do like campfire, you know, in a normal summer camp, you have a campfire, you have the, the kids sitting around to keep the fire and sing some songs. So I mean, instead of singing, say, bingo or she'll be coming around to mountain, they can sing, you know, some old two-puck, uh, she cool classics or sing, uh, sing, uh, Fug to police. I don't forget Miss Peaches. Yeah. Miss Peaches or sing some, uh, notorious B.I.G. tunes. You know, good campfire music. And then about, uh, one in the morning, just give the kids some crack, you know, get them ready for bed. And, uh, and that, and that's a day right there. Perfect, Nigger Summer Camp. That's, uh, that's a good day. You got any ideas to add to the Nigger Summer Camp experience black metal? Well, I was thinking that you would get more of your disadvantaged youths as, uh, the liberals would call it. So you'd have to have in there some, uh, marksmanship training, uh, with AK-47s. You know, they got to make sure they got the right stance, legs spread, holding it sideways. A good old-fashioned spray and prey. Hope that they, you know, can at least hit some of the bystanders. Uh, another good one would be, uh, you know, this would be arts and crafts or, uh, it would be graffiti, but they would have to take, uh, some purple drink as it's called, uh, a bottle of, uh, robotosin, what have you, see how high they can get and see what kind of graffiti they can make on the walls of their mudhots. Oh, how about a rape class? Oh, no, no, no. That's a bad idea because Nigger's know how to rape from birth. It kind of comes natural. I hate to shoot you down like that. That's true. I think he's on the something. See, what they need to do is teach them how do you, uh, get used to mace the quickest way of, uh, pinning down a person and briefing whatever orifice or, you know, just behind the knees or armpit, whatever they can get to as fast as they can. That's what they need to know this kind of stuff. I mean, there's just so much something they can do. They can make like, uh, make a, say, make a portrait of a 50 cent out of macaroni, uh, you know, or, uh, you know, uh, make a, uh, like a picture of a housing project out of construction paper. I mean, there's so much Nigger's could do at a good Nigger summer camp, you know, and, and, and the counselors, of course, would be, uh, you know, typical Nigger drug addicts and, uh, welfare recipients and, you know, whether it's scum you can round up and any perfect role models for the negligence, uh, because they would teach him basically what their future would be like. Well, the campfire, the campfire actually they wouldn't be using wood. They would be using typical Nigger fair like, uh, use tires, radiator hoses, uh, gasoline, uh, you know, books because they don't need books. I think they'd, uh, dredge up some of the, uh, drown nigglets too. That could be some good fire right there. They just, uh, roll them around on the spit, you know, put an apple in his mouth. Well, you might as well have a pig roast out there, you know. Uh, I mean, God, I mean, I, I don't know who would eat that, but still. And, uh, well, I mean, there's, how the activities I guess they could go canoeing. So I, I don't know how to believe Nigger's what I go out into water like that. Um, God, what else? I guess there's sports. I can play some, uh, yeah, he took it to work out of my mouth. Uh, you know, some back of ball and they can, they can learn how to do their slam dunks and, um, maybe, uh, well, no practice some football and, and so on dances. Well, it's an idea. I will for a summer camp if they have a summer camp for girls, you know, they got to give, uh, proper nigger parenting classes to the six, seven-year-old, uh, nigglets, owls to prepare them for eventually when they become pregnant at nine. And, it's really quite wide open. I mean, actually, to make it fun, I think, and give an award to, uh, whoever gets pregnant first before the camp is over. The winner is, the winner is Shiniikwa. She got pregnant ten minutes. They should also teach them how to fill out their well for, well-fear, uh, forms properly. That is, uh, some good advance now and, uh, dance knowledge for the Nigger too soon will be living off the system. Of course. Well, you got to teach them the skills, and that skills, especially with a Z, like zebra at the end, the skills they'll need to, uh, get by in the real world. How to fill out a well for forms. Uh, you know, how to, um, I don't know, you know, how to get whatever they can, like, government, how to get a section A department, how to get food stamps, you know, what you can buy with food stamps, what you can't, uh, you know, basically how to, how to lie about your means so you can get more welfare. You know, how much of money you got to pernigulate that you get first to. Denying paternity. Of course. You know, how to sign up for the Mori show. So, basically, basically needs that young Niggers, uh, need to get by in life. Yeah. So these Niggers somewhere can be a very positive thing, I think, for our African-American youth, where they can, they can learn some skills that'll serve them well in their life as, uh, useless, worthless, scummy ass burdens on society. So I, I think Obongo should provide some federal funding for this stuff. Yeah, Nigger Summer Camps. That would be perfect. I mean, you could, humans could have their summer camps and, you know, the Nigglets could have their summer camps. And it would be culturally culturally relevant as well. Well, actually, truth be told, if it was up to me, this is what my idea of a Nigger Summer Camp would be like. You take a big space shuttle. Before it gets to be a really science space shuttle to be able to fit, you know, at least a few thousand Niggers. So it had to be sort of like a sort of like a slave spaceship, basically. You could fill a lot of Niggers in a relatively small space. Shoot them off into space. The end. That's summer camp. Let the vacuum of space take care of what we have. Yeah, that'll be their camp. Basically, bloating and exploding in the vacuum of space. How about that? I think we forgot one thing, too.\n",

Moonman's rap's be really on top of the game, kill some niggers, people praise my name, but nigger killing isn't everything I do, for years now I've been shanking Jews, shank the spear that's my tool, killing spicks, and air ups too. Went to the gun shop to do some shopping all the while watching niggers dropping, I stocked up on white supremacy, Elliott Roger, writing my 69 Corvette I make minced meat of any nigger I can't get. Moonman back for the second verse. Shout out to my nigger killing bros and bg, who have it worse? No spearchuckers smoking dope to be found there but plenty of sand niggers to impair. Fucking no one cares if you drench their numbers, so kill, rape, and do us wonders. Wonders like the great beener wall by my man in trump towers to make killings picks fun for hours. Black lives don't matter you fucking nigger monkeys. Moonman Moonman can't you see, you obviously can't, since picks and niggers are filling the trees, the next time someone says that I am going to set some niggers on them. Fucking listen to all the songs you piece of trash, go kill yourself, now to continue with the song, but no time left to say how I'm gonna make every nigger gray. But fuck it the moon has never followed any laws, to make any drop on the train to the concentration camp, taxation camp, or any other Hebrew pain and using tramp, women should receive the sourly, except the fat ones, that will devour me, I play riddles with any SJW cuts with my fingers on the triggers for any shatrationalization for the killing of niggers. Most women for the lot are not better than any niggers whining on the spot for being triggered. Like who the fuck cares you disgusting cunt, keep walking, if I'm not fucking you, you shouldn't be talking. This ends now, you misogynist big, women are fed up with your disgusting g- And you're dead. And I feel, like a butcher well, since I have slain by fat cow. I guess my AK did it like your toe, best fully auto I've ever owned. Tumple is probably my oldest enemy, resisting to recognize male supremacy. But for all the years the moon has made women me, I now know that a good dicking is what sets them free, fucking cucks were a mistake. Free as the fucking liberal, until he gets picked down by a black criminal, ruffies the opposite of flame retardant, everything ice but does insane retard it, I bring profound sound when I swing through your town, so turn that shit up, and turn that soul-joy down, I travel past my hometown, lynching all the cucks. The a proud member of the white race you fucking disgusting subhuman, when you see a groid you act just like your woman. In the final set I'm going to set my dogs on every nigger, Arab or any Jews I can't find, killing Jews is the best pastime. Killing Arabs comes to mind while the KKK will handle the killing of the whole nigger kind. Moonman 2015 Gilling Niggers is my game.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_277.mp3:  Your Ashley Babitt was killed at the United States Capitol during a political protest on January 2006, 2021. She was unarmed and intentionally shot at a close range. During a rightful revolt of the oppressed and betrayed people against the extremely corrupt and treacherous government, a nigger policeman, or security officer, hides in ambush, stalks, slowly aims his gun then kills the white woman in cold blood, all of it is filmed but nothing happens to him. If it was a case of a white policeman killing a negro, criminal, it would be the end of the world. Cities would burn, the whites would be massacred and that white person would be in jail for life. USA is one evil and terribly unjust country where white people are discriminated and horribly brainwashed, abused, exploited, and terrorized just for being white. Subhumans, negroes, mongolos, mongrels, have all the rights but white people, especially white men, have none. Worst of all, USA have been transferring all their factories, wealth, knowledge, and technology to China which will result in a total catastrophe, the sixth and final global or mass extinction event and the planet will die. Life will be terminated. Americans are in utter disgrace. Instead of protecting white people and championing white race, our advanced culture and civilization, they are actually tolerating and assisting or enabling subhumans, especially the Chinese, to destroy everything. They are letting China steal their election in front of the world as to place their corrupt and compromised puppets, China Joe and Negro Kamala, in power. Trump and USA are a bloody joke. Nonetheless, the Americans must fight China, arrest the traitors or US will die and the world with it. Fight to death, defeat them or die trying, for otherwise you'll be responsible for enabling subhumans to destroy our planet, to perform on-the-side total and complete eradication of all life on earth.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_263.mp3:  Hey guys, moonman here. It's been a heck of a long time since I last made a video like this. I've been busy doing my duty to the white race by mowing down the browns, catapulting spikes over the wall and hanging niggers from trees. Since the death of George Floyd, the Nignox have been losing their shit and like 1992, they have decided that the best way to teach us white people a lesson is for them to burn down their own neighborhoods, businesses, and homes in the name of racial justice. You are probably thinking. Moonman, why make a video about the niggers destroying their mudhuts? That does not hurt the white race at all. The problem is that white soy boy-faggot communists have decided that this will be the perfect time to begin the red revolution on America's streets. The fucking Democrats have shown their true colors and come out in defense of the niggers and pinkos. District attorneys are automatically releasing rioters that have been arrested for horrific acts of violence. The police are being defunded or stood down by leftist mayors or just outright being disbanded by these communist traitors. They believe that the average American is as brain dead as their puppet, Joe I got hairy legs by then and will swallow their blatant lies as much as their soy boy-cuckoots love choking on black dick every day. Well don't worry fellow freedom lovers. Moonman is back and I'm going to be sending these commies crying back to their mummies. Vote Trump 2020 and have a blessed white day.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_511.mp3:  On the begin though with the conservative radio host who calls the Zimmerman trial side show Larry Elder is the host of Larry Elder show on KBC and also the author of Dear Father Dear Son and he joins me now Larry Elder. Welcome to. Welcome thank you very much for having me I appreciate it you've been pretty scathing about my interview with Rachel Gentell why. I was because you are doing her any favors by condescendingly trying to convince her that she's a victim this is a young lady who didn't apply herself a 19 year old who still in high school instead of saying young lady take this as an opportunity to take stock of your life you treat her like she was a victim and that's how you're doing this whole thing about race and racism 7000 murders last year Pierce of black people almost all of the people by black people since Trayvon Martin has his unfortunate death there have been 480 blacks killed in Chicago alone. 75% of those crimes have been unsolved where are the cameras where the shows is outrageous black America Larry black America should fear some non black guys talking some black kid at night the likelihood of a black person being killed by by a non black person is extremely remote which is why this became a big national issue in the first place Pierce right is perfectly possible as we have shown on the show many times to be just as exercised by what is happening in Chicago which is an absolute. National disgrace to America frankly in terms of the outland but you're not but you're not here. I am a 7000. Wait a minute half of the matter watch my show half of the murders in this country are committed by black people even though black people are 12% of the population which means 6% of the population is committing almost half the murders and you throw out the old people and the young people Pierce you're talking about 3% of the population committing almost 50% of the murder this one. I was going to make a lot of people. His the point I was going to make I'm I'm I'm I'm as bothered by how you're handling all the making let me speak Larry it's nonsense it's nonsense Larry I can just bleeding heart liberal person you think you're doing something for black people you're not you're making black people feel as if they're under siege and it's not true it's an outrage. Thank you like if I can just get a word you know the great. Here's my point I completely agree with everything was saying about Chicago. All right let's just get that on the table I'll be saying this repeat it is a show it's a disgrace what's happening in Chicago particularly with all these young black teenagers killing other young black teenagers and the president of people down have to deal with it but let's get back to the Zimmerman trial the skip back to my with Rachel Gentelle because you tweeted some ridiculous things you treated at one stage would I like Rachel Gentelle to fly my plane. Why would you say I said that Pierce I'll tell you why I said that because after you interview her you condescendingly went on television the next morning and called her one smart cookie. Bull why don't you hire her as a nanny let's see how smart she is it's a condescending kind of thing she's cheap to learn to black people I think you're stupid for saying that kind of thing to try to get black. I'm losing my question race and racism do you think Rachel Gentelle is when it doesn't do you think she's cheap in America anymore peers racism is not a major problem in America anymore. The number one problem facing black people are the large number of black people born outside of Weblock 75% in 1965% of all people in this country were born outside of Weblock fast forward Pierce and number now is 43%. You look at that for crime dropouts all that kind of stuff is connected the other big problem facing black America Pierce is the economy one and two black men does not have a job and one of the heads of the the correct black caucus once said if a white person were in the White House we marching on the place because the high unemployment but we're talking about Travon Martin and George Irman as if it's the number one problem facing black America it isn't remotely on the top 10 list. Okay. No this isn't an sort of competition to see who can be the greatest filibuster in my show's history. I'm not trying to fill a bus. If you could just get a common sense let me just get on your show. Let me just get back to the question I asked you and see if you can actually ask the question. Do you think the Rachel Gentell is stupid? I think that I would rather have a George Irman living in my neighborhood and maybe for George Irman living in my neighborhood we'd have a few fewer aureo castles. I thought we wanted people to be proactive. I was wondering if the question Larry say something. I know I'm answering something different that ought to be interesting. He's just on some of my question men like he's some sort of criminal. He's not a criminal. George Irman is about his neighborhood. He's a neighborhood watch guy. I don't you want people to be proactive and there was crime in that neighborhood Pierce. I live in South Central. The wasn't crime from trade on Marston and the bar is not on there. The burglar bars are not on there because of George Irman. They're on there because of the minority of thug in the community that's messing up everybody's image and reputation. This is why people profile instead of being angry at George Irman be angry at the minority with the thug that's giving these crimes a crime. If I could jump in again. Just to clarify. Trade on Marston wasn't committing crimes in that neighborhood. Was he? It was an unfortunate incident. Two people have preconceived notions about each other. It never should have been happened. Doesn't make George Irman a criminal. I used to work in the DA's office Pierce. I'm telling you it was a dog case, a reasonable doubt case. Nobody I know would have filed the case. Yeah, we disagree, obviously, about that. I think it's completely wrong. Obviously. The George Irman should get no punishment at all for killing an unarmed teenager. He's got serious punishment. He can't go anywhere. Are you kidding? He's a mark man. He's going to be sued civilly. He will never have a moment of peace. He killed somebody. More only he's got to deal with that Pierce. He recognizes that. Well, he's not an... Larry, but may he recognize what he did? I may respond. Some people would say that he's got it easy compared to Trevor Martin who he killed. So much as people feel sorry for George Irman not being able to lead the life perhaps he wished he could. At least he can lead a life. At least he can lead a life. At least he can lead a life. I don't want George Irman to in my neighborhood watch patrol. No, I've got three teenage sons Larry. I don't feel comfortable having somebody like George Zimmerman marching around as someone want to be vigilante. You live in a wealthy neighborhood community. You live in a wealthy neighborhood, gay to community, plenty of security. You don't have to worry about that. Live in South Central. Come down to South Central sometime. See what's going on down there. They're not worried about George Irman. They're not worried about Mark Firman. They're worried about the thug down the street coming from a single parent household. And that situation has been created by the left wing people like you who feel sorry for people. And therefore you want government to take care of them. You think government is the way to help you and some prosperity. Go to an Indian reservation sometime and see how they're living. Okay, Larry. Larry. I do feel sorry for some people. That is true. I wasn't aware that was a terrible offense. But let me get back to Rachel Gentella again because you were very scared. You were scared of the wrong things to do. Larry, let me speak. Larry, let me speak. Larry. Larry. Oh, I feel sorry for you. All this person is a bigot. All this person shouldn't have crossed the examines you the way he did. Then all you're doing is creating a victim. You're telling Rachel, John Taylor, that she shouldn't have the work hard. She shouldn't have the work on her addiction. She shouldn't have the improvement, improve her grammar. Just have her wave the flag of victimhood and she'll be perfectly okay. It is an outrage that the left has done to black people and you are part of this parade. Thank you, Larry. Just out of interest, how many languages do you speak? I don't speak ebonics as well as Rachel. That's what you mean. How many languages do you speak was the question? And the relevance of that is what? You don't think she's a smart cookie. She speaks three languages fluently. How many do you speak? Oh, really? You think she's a smart cookie. So you want to bring it back to Rachel. That's not what we're talking about. I think you've been talking about it. I want to bring it back to Rachel. Because that was why people like Sharon. How you treat a black people like children to whom the truth cannot be told. Rachel Gentella needs to get her act together. If my mother were alive, she would say, how dare she speak like that. Do you know her educational background? Larry. Well, that's in the third grade. I know how she presented herself on the jury. Larry, do you know her educational background? People evaluate you based on the way you express yourself. Larry, do you know her educational background? This young 19-year-old black woman that you are this serrating for her lack of intelligence. Do you have any idea about her background? Why don't you hire her if she's so sharp as a co-host? There wasn't a question, Larry. Do you want to hire her educational background? Yes or no? I know how she came across on the jury. I want to ask you a question, Larry. Do you know anything talking about this fear of the truth? Because I think it's relevant. Let me talk about something. Let me ask Larry. I don't talk about Rachel Gentella. Let's talk about what Larry is. Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry. For black America. It is not. You are implying that it is. It is not. As we speak, there's a guy in prison right now in Phoenix, a black guy in an SUV with his fiance killed a Hispanic who cut in front of him. Larry. He has a wife and a wife. The guy who was arrested right away, had the Hispanic family not agitated. The guy who had never been arrested. Where are the cameras? Larry. You have some white guy do something or some non-white guy do something to a black person. We want to march on Washington. Larry, let me just... You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Larry, thank you. If I could just bring you up to speed on Rachel Gentella, this woman that you think is so stupid. I didn't say stupid you did. She actually suffered when she... It's with her lawyer today before I interviewed you. This is why I booked you, of course. Even though you're trying to pretend now this is the last thing you want to talk about, that is why I booked you. Rachel Gentella, when she was young at school, had a lot of time off school and fell behind because of illness. That was why she wasn't able to go to school. She was actually doing very well. She was at B grade at high school until her great friend, Trevor Martin, was shot dead by George Zimmerman. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm just... I haven't seen her in any kind of grades. Her grades have since slipped to do something. Because of the stress that she suffered, understandably from the death of her friend, Trayvon, she's now been offered a chance by Tom Joyner and his people from his foundation to go to college, you just have to get those grades back up and make something of herself. Why would you... I think that's wonderful, Peter. Why would you be so scathing about Rachel Gentella and so patronizing to a young woman who's clearly been through an appalling ordeal? And who, when I interviewed her, I found to be a smart cookie, like I said, I found it to be fun, warm, engaging, street smart. And clearly from her educational background, no one near as stupid as you like to think she is. Once again, I never used the word stupid you did. She was the most important witness in a murder trial. She was standing between George Zimmerman and 30 years in jail. And for you to act as if she was somehow abused by Don West, whose job was to make sure his client didn't go to jail, is outrageous. And as far as education is concerned, I applaud Mr. Joyner. He's done a lot of work in the black community for education. And I would recommend, Peter, that we do something about the 50% dropout rate in the inner city, and about the fact that President Obama opposes allowing parents to use vouchers to get their kids out of bad government schools, and into a better school so they can have a possibility to get to the middle class. That's what we got to be talking about here, instead of some aberrant situation, like George Zimmerman, going to see somebody that he thinks is suspicious, and they have an exchange, and there's an unfortunate death, as if somehow that's some sort of indictment of America, and black people should look over their shoulders every night, and act as if some white guy is going to jump out of a bush and get them. It is outrageous. Hard work wins, get an education, don't pay attention to negative people, and stay focused, and you'll be okay in America. That's why most of the people in the world want to come here. That's why you want to come here, Pierce. Thank you, Larry Aldo.\n",

The city of Chicago was in the midst of a polar vortex, temperatures as low as 30 degrees below zero. It was no longer the windy city, but it was an Arctic Chicago. The city was under siege by no other than mother nature herself. The day was cold, and the night was as frigid as Rebecca King proves. When she sit there and witnessed her husband, Terry Hughes, standing there and being bondled by Hollywood mogul as suspected bisexual family man Adam Venet. But neither the deep freeze frigid temperatures, nor the darkness of the devils, which he now could stop our protagonist, Jesse, the reluctant hero, and self-proclaimed Super B**** in his quest to bring Super gay to the world. The first, I need to show my boss, Lee Lee Daniels, that I'm famous enough to bring the gay superhero movie, that he has in development to the big screen. Love you, Lee Lee. So Jesse Wander, what if I put my plan into motion? But first, I'll need some people. But wait, I just got some friends that got here from Africa. So let me call those 69-year-olds and get this thing moving. There are big u-was-legay. There are big u-was-legay. The ambiguously gay duo. So where you're at, girl? So where is open 24 hours for a reason? So then when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to subway. Subway is open 24 hours for a reason. So then when you're hungry at night and you ain't got no food, you go to subway. Oh boy, I thought everybody forgot we were accused of being a hangar for pedophiles. Damn you cool-watch. You might feel fresh on girls out. Nor kill you had to go to shit or do me. Oh my gosh, this footnote is tasty. It tastes like sweaty meat. Hey little jussie, it's what? No, country sweet thing. Hey, Nigerian boys. Oh no, not me. No, why you wanna treat me so bad? Why you wanna treat me so bad? Now little jussie, click this hill twice and use his powers of pansy, Nancy, why it's a fancy to make a fantasy to tell the world. Oh my gosh, did you hear that? Oh god. After worldwide acceptance of his fantasy story, Jesse couldn't stop there. He went further. And above all, I fought the fuck back. Jesse got the big hit and he went even further. I'm the K-SOO Park. I'm the K-SOO Park. Gay actor attacked by two men wearing magams. I don't think so. Let's see if he's who we think he is. It's him, alright? Oh my god. All of jussies, LGBT friends, have turned their backs on him. They're so disappointed like gay Tyler Perry and gay him. And some find it unacceptable like John Legend. And WS AOC doesn't know what to think. Which tweet? What tweet? About saying that it is a modern day in lynching. Um, okay, which tweet? If I had said it was a Muslim or a Mexican or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me a lot much more. Did I make that up too? Did I make that up too? I'm sorry.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_124.mp3:  Afternoon folks, how is everybody? I was just listening to Tim Poole and I have to laugh my ass off. So I'm going to assume that if you're watching this channel you have some idea with Poole Lewis. But the... give you a little backstory. Tim Poole six months ago was so anti-gun. Super lefty whatever. And I said back then he's just playing it. He's just doing it as a marketing ratings thing. Nobody can be that stupid. Gotta stop saying that. But uh... he go on, he do his stick and do his stories and then he contradict himself and I'd be like... While back I did a video about people who will only go to the edge of the box but never look over the edge and Tim was the perfect example. All the evidence would be there and boom right up against the cardboard and you want to look over the edge it's too scary to look over the top of the box. Peace all that information together so you know what's really going on in the world. The Boogelloo boys. So apparently the left is terrified of these horrible Boogelloo people who want to take over the government and they're all horrible white extremists and primists and all this other bullshit and I'm listening to this and I'm fucking laughing. So just you understand and they're all terrified of civil war. Just you understand. I understand the whole Boogelloo movement and I'm not one of them. The Boogelloo movement would be something more akin to patriots, people who are sick and tired of the crap going on in their country. They will most likely be center right to right but not super far right. These people would be more likely to know the Constitution backwards and forwards than a politician. But they're sick and tired of thermoclimate today's killer man from Wendee Old Data. But three percenters are at the thing and the concept of three percentence and only took three percent of the population to overthrow the British and get them out of the country three percent. Tea party years. These guys are the next evolutionary extension except for the fact that they are just people who share the same opinion. It's not Antifa. It's not the clan. These are just Americans who want America to go back to being America without a K. Now to stay what I'm saying here. These are just people who are sick and tired of watching their country devolve. Every special interest group gets points over the guy who goes to work every day. Black Lives Matter is now a super thing and morons are busy apologizing for shit they never get. The rainbow mafia and their strong-armed tactics to get their shit put through. Well you know what? While not every gay person is involved in pedophilia there's a large section of the rainbow mafia political movement. You see this come up every now and again and the gay people freaking no it's not us. I'm not a book a little guy. So I could understand but the fact of the matter is this is what's going on here. It is shit like this that has pushed the whole concept of Bougaloo. Now pay attention because this is important. The whole Bougaloo thing is a sia being run on you. Well maybe not you in particular but definitely being run on the carons and the Ivan's and the weak-minded sheeple of the planet. Libertarians have a great expression we want to take over the government and leave you alone. Kind of out the Bougaloo guys want to do too. They want to take over the government. Restructure it back to the way it's supposed to be and then fuck back off to leave me alone land so the people leave them alone and I come back them to the wall on that. No problems with that concept because that's the way it should be. But as far as it's an organized movement of white supremacists Nazi racist KKK members who hate America. No. No. That is exactly not what it is. Just relax folks. Unless you have pink hair and wear a vagina hat to screech every time something happens run up the people in the street yelled them for not wearing a mask and do all the other things that basically the other sia up with it turning you into communists. If you rat on your neighbors because that's what a good epipharactic does then you get something to worry about the Bougaloo boys. It's a joke. It's the next iteration of epa. Okay take it with that one. Ice cubes means fruity. But this is staring at now but this is all part of the plan. Sia don't fall for it. You know those Bougaloo guys might be your neighbors if they exist. So I'm just going to go with this. I think the Bougaloo man only comes for all the bad zoys and zerls who don't rat on your neighbors and wear their masks and eat their tofu kale, rainbow mackerel, a lot of whatever the hell those friggin people eat. They're not terrorists. They're not even real. Fucking joke. I gotta go inside now and put my Hawaiian shirt and my battle gear on and go to the meetin. Oh folks don't fall for this shit. Okay. We're just terrorizing you for the friggin profit margin. I'm gonna do headlines next but this is too funny. Alright remember if you are gonna Bougaloo can't press that Hawaiian shirt. It's gotta have wrinkles in it. Make sure you match your Hawaiian camos here and there. I'm gonna laugh like that forever. You might suprimously don't not. I want to take over the go. Wanna overthrow the government. No. I need to go and go friggin right out of the studio. I hate my friends.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_332.mp3:  Thanks for joining me and this is just a quick little story that's just for funsies. I hadn't seen too many daytime moons since I was like a kid and then all of a sudden I saw a few this summer. Now it kind of tripped me out the first time I saw one because it looked more like the death star than a moon. It was very indistinctive. It was kind of like a gray ball blob and then I got a film to contrast that of a daytime moon that happened like a few days later. It was much easier to see so I want to show you this. I don't know if it means anything or not. I think it's just probably the lighting I don't know. But it is pretty weird looking moon. The other thing I apologize for is it is really hard to hold a camcorder steady and film the moon without a tripod. So I'm on the side of the road doing this because I couldn't get a view of this thing unless I pulled the car over and stopped. I tried to steady the best I could but it's just not that good. It won't hold a steer clenched. A clear steady shot when I zoom in. So I have to apologize for that too but you can get a good idea though. It does catch it for a few seconds here and there. Well take a look at this footage. So this is what a normal daytime moon looks like. You can see the features and the contrast compared to this quick little clip I'm going to show you here of the Death Star moon. So here take a look. Hello everybody. I am in Vermont and I'm driving out to Ohio to hang out with Unirok and catch a wedding. And I see something really odd which I have not seen since this little kid. And that is a daytime moon. I'm going to try to show you it and it looks really weird. Take this thing out. Right there. You guys see that? Daytime moon. It's been hold a steadyer right there. I don't know if that got it or not but I hope it did. There it is. The daytime moon. Check it. Wow. I can't even focus on it. Can I see it right there? It's going in and out. I won't focus on it very well. Feel free to leave a comment below if you thought that was a strange looking moon or if that's just like a lighting effect. I don't really know. I'm not trying to stir something up but I thought I'd show it to you guys. So you take a look. Also you know I'm on all these alternative networks. Feel free to hit me up over there and chat me up. And let's not forget. I'm trying to get on. Oh, it's this way. It's Patreon. If you enjoy little fun stories like this, feel free to check me out on Patreon and consider sponsoring the show for just a dollar a month. I really appreciate it. If you're on YouTube, continue to keep watching my stories. Go ahead and click one of these and I hope you'll keep watching my stories all day. Enjoy yourself.\n",

Okay, two low life old pork chop shotgun having edomites. Alright, that put up a live video on YouTube and claim they were going GMS Kuhn hunting. Okay. Now, like one of the brothers was saying, I believe his name is Amawanka Bar. Alright, this channel is a GMS awakening, bar 144, I believe. Like he was saying, not one so-called Kuhn was hunted that day. Okay, no GMS members was confronted by those edomites, man. Alright, and through the spirit and power of Yahweh Shami, I was shy. You know, we like edomites like that. Okay, edomites that are straightforward, you know, they're not hiding who they are. Okay, and like the elder down there in Dallas said, elder Yashawamba said, the e-saws hurt, man. Ultimately, he's hurt. Okay, and this proves that the edomites are not the Arabs, man. A salaki, yeah. Yeah, the edomites are not the Arabs. Okay, because you don't see Arabs doing things of that nature or having that type of behavior towards Jake. You know, yeah, the Arabs had their part in the transatlantic slave trade and they set up their, you know, stores in your neighborhoods or have you would not, but they don't have that attitude towards Jake like the so-called white man does. Okay, and that video was spiritual because you're going to have a lot of edomites doing things like that, man. Okay, you're going to have a lot of edomites doing things like that. Alright, because this word is getting to Esau. What does this say? And as it is written in Hebrews 4 and 12, for the words of the most highest quick and powerful and sharper than any two-air sword. Okay, so this word is getting to these devils, man. This word has reached until the four corners of the earth. Alright, and there's nothing Esau can do about it, man. Only thing he can do is cry and complain. You know, and you know, pretty soon he's going to bring out his sword in the time of Jacob's trouble. He's going to bring out the big guns. But those were low level edomites anyway, you know, that claim that they believe in Jesus, sweet Jesus. Alright, but that's what Esau did during the time of slavery, man. He hated you. He had that perpetual hatred towards us in the name of what? Jesus, man. Okay, not yet how was shot, but Jesus. Alright, and that's why the Apostle Paul said if any other, if they preach any other Jesus, alright, because there is such thing as another Jesus, man. And that's Chesa Rae Boer's year. That's not yet how was shot of the Bible. Alright, but not to get off topic. Like I said, those two edomites, alright, I believe his name was Billy or Bob. Something like that. Fucking Hill, Billy. That's what he was. Alright, you know, Esau is upset, man. And I just want to say, you know, that video was spiritual. You know, it's very spiritual, man, that these, because you don't see a video of these guys saying, we're going IUIC, Cooom hunting or ISUPK, Cooom hunting, G-O-C-C, Cooom hunting. You don't see videos like that. Why? Because those camps are not on fire like the men of Great Milestone. Okay. And a lot of you Israelite camps, you don't even really push the destruction of America or the destruct, or the upcoming slavery of the edomites. A lot of you camps don't even push that, man. You know, a lot of you camps don't push the downfall of our enemies. Alright, so that's, that proves that what the men of Great Milestone, okay, where the ones that saw fire and the men that's teaching our doctrine, the doctrine that we teach starting with the head of apostles, where the ones that saw fire for this word, man. Alright. So, but, but you know what? That's just the beginning of things, man. You know, the scripture is safe for the love of many shall wax cold. So that's really just the beginning of what you're going to start to see with these damn devils, man. Alright, because the time of Jacob's trouble is going to, is going to approach very, very soon. And then you're going to know who your enemies are, man. Then you're going to know who's, who's the damn devil that the Bible speaks of? Who's the physical carnation of Satan on the planet earth, man? Which is the edomites and it's not the Arabs. It's the, it's the so-called white man, the Caucasian race today. Okay. The cave dwellers of the earth, the descendants of Esau et Adam. Alright. And in the kingdom, guess what? We're going to go eat them might hunting, man. Okay. And Esau is going to be hunted down every single day. Alright. Only break you going to get us on the Sabbath, man. And soon as that sun, the soon as that sun go down on the Sabbath, we're going to be right back on your ass, man. Right back on your ass. Okay. That's the only rest you're going to get, man. Because you're going to be in full, hardcore slavery, full, hardcore bondage, man. You ain't going to be no employees in the kingdom. You're going to be slaves. And your women are going to be concubines. And your daughters are going to be concubines. And your sons are going to be slaves. Okay. That's the Bible. That's the holy Bible. That's the word of your how about shimmy how was shy? Okay. But we know we know you we know Esau is coming. You know, he's going to have his his FEMA troops and his foreign troops. They're going to come they're going to also lucky your brothers. They're going to come at the the\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_327.mp3:  Several days before Tuesday's equinox, I started to notice movement in Earth's magnetic field. It suddenly felt like shifting sand under my feet and a wobble in the astral plane. I woke up three nights in a row, being called to protect the star gates with other gate keepers. There was an unusual amount of activity in the non-physical realm. Then I noticed people posting that their animals were subdued and birds were quiet. Those sensitive to energy were becoming aware of a magnetic shift happening. During the equinox event, I saw a heavy, oppressive magnetic layer unlock from Earth's aura, opening us to new energy. magnetic fields operate as buffer zones, compressing particles and creating time lag. When magnetic fields weaken or dissolve, time lines spring open, freeing stock energy. You may experience rapid release of unlocked trauma, memories and fears. What was blocked or hidden now become visible and accessible. In this manner, our world reality expands with more possibilities. According to spaceweather.com, a powerful stream of solar wind, hot plasma, ejected from the sun and is impacting Earth's magnetic field this week. Unlike solar flares that affect the electrical grid, these solar winds alter the magnetic field. Not only do they shift the magnetics in our personal energy field, but they alter the capacity of the mind. Don't be surprised if you see more folks waking up. In addition to solar wind activity, Mercury turned retrograde in aries, shaking loose hidden personal agendas and tightly held secrets. Mercury retrograde in aries highlights issues around what you desire and your ability or lack thereal to create what you want in life. During this three week transit, we have the opportunity to explore the core motivation of our desires, is it ego-driven or sole expression? More issues are emerging as one of the themes of 2018. Mercury retrograde in aries offers time for review and investigation into core power issues. Who and what is driving your desires and do they empower you or weaken you? The magnetics are opening new timelines to all seeking personal ascension and enlightenment. Next article. On Friday, March 31, a full moon rises at 10 degrees Libra, a blue moon, the second full moon of the month. In addition, this full moon is opposite Mercury retrograde and square Mars, creating tension in the planetary field. During this transit, those who are gullible to mind control can be manipulated by blatant lies. Below your spiritual practice, maintain your inner zero point, soul connection, and empathic discernment. We are witnessing karmic retribution for the misinformation deceivers grabbing power at the expense of the vast majority. The illuminating solar rays are flushing out the hidden dark agenda and reveal all in the light of truth. If it doesn't radiate love, it is not of the light. The wear of propagated lies and conspiracies that plug you into the dark matrix program. If it is not uplifting and opens your heart, it is constructing your energy. The wear of the controlling fear programs and polarizing competition that trigger your primal self. We will be broadcasting a timely podcast discussion on Saturday, March 31 about the recent equinox, magnetic shifts, and the full moon ripple. This is a powerful ascension upgrade that propels us to the next level of living our soul's life. If you cannot attend a live broadcast, the replay will be available at the event link. The recording is accessible within minutes upon completion of the show broadcast. Lovingly, Meg.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_441.mp3:  It's not about crappy little Israel anymore. It's about the three Israel's. It begins with Genocide of Israel. That sits on Stolen Land, covered with a blood of its centuries-old possessors, the Palestinians, who've been slaughtered and dispossessed by the Jews. Alongside is greater Israel, the hegemonic mischief maker that uses America to fight its wars in Syria, Iraq, and before long Lebanon and Iran. Moving beyond is gigantic Israel entrenched in the political culture of the US and Europe and embedded in Jewish global army, NATO. Lieberman spilled the beans. I agree with John McCain that when the President turned over leadership to NATO in one sense that was exactly the right thing to do because we can't fight every good fight in the world alone. We need our allies. I appreciate that they've come in. But we're the heart of NATO. And it's not as exactly as if we took the ball and gave it to NATO. We're still NATO. If America is the heart of NATO, then given Jewish influence in DC, Israel pumps its genocidal blood through NATO's global veins. From civilization has morphed into the Atlanticist security state, which throws Europe under America's bus beholden to Zionist interests. For with the individual cooperation program, ICP, the Mediterranean dialogue, and with an Israeli ambassador to NATO, Israel burrows itself within the Western security state. Mr. General, Secretary General, I want to start by thanking you for the important and welcome decisions to allow Israel to open an office of NATO's headquarter. This will help Israel and it will help NATO, I hope, strengthening our cooperation and our good relation. I will help, it will help us share best practices and information. That means massage with genocidal Israel, greater Israel. Organic Israel, spinning its web through shared private information, massage can stealthily advance a Jewish agenda. And like a spider in tangling its prey, the three israils with its foreign lobbies, embassies, and participation in stacks of security networks, Jewish quest for a one-world governance is hard to shake. The national jury at the center of Zionism wheels the levers of global finance, forex, swift, letters of credit, forefading along with its control of the West Central Banks. Jerome Powell is simply gentle, winter dressing. Roll up the blinds and the three israils, backed by a global Jewish financial system, loom large in the shadows. And let's hit in the shadows Israel's nooks need not fire, for Israel's tentacles have spread throughout the world.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_333.mp3:  Hi everyone, I'm Mary with Mary Gridley News. Thank you for joining me. Why in the world would MIT make a fake video, supposedly showing President Nixon making to speak about the failed Apollo mission? There's a document that's posted online. It's an archives from the government about a speech that President Nixon would give in the event of a disaster and it's dated July 18th and 1969. Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men kneel aren't strong and Edwin Aldrin know that there is no hope for the recovery but they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice. These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal, the search for truth and understanding. We don't have that these days. They will be mourned and by their families and friends they will be mourned by their nation. They will be mourned by the people of the world. They will be mourned by more than Earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown. In their exploration they stirred the people of the world to feel as one in their sacrifice. They bind more tightly the brotherhood of man. In the ancient days men looked to the stars and saw their heroes in the constellations and modern times we do much the same. But our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood. Others will follow and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks at the moon in the night to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind. And then the paper says prior to the President's statement the President should tell from each of the widows to be. After the President's statement at the point when NASA ends communication with the men, a clergyman should adopt the same procedure as a burial at sea, commending their souls to the deepest of the deep, concluding with the Lord's Prayer. One Twitter post says that lawmakers are already concerned that deep fake videos could threaten national security and interfere in elections. Now MIT explores whether they have the potential to rewrite history. So how much did it cost to make this video a President Nixon making the speech? There's already enough controversy about whether we went to the moon or not. You know President Nixon never actually gave this Apollo 11 disaster speech with, yeah, it sure raises a lot of questions. Why do it? Are they just showing the potential to fake stuff? Yeah, like I said, all they have to do is shut down the internet, control the internet which Google is already doing. You don't know if a real war broke out or not. You wouldn't know if there was truly a mass shooting somewhere. You get so much fake news out there. If there was truly a disaster that people should prepare for, they probably wouldn't do it, thinking it was fake. When people should be heading to the bunkers, they'll still be out there mowing their lawns. Did they do this as a warning for a wets to come or what has already been posted on mainstream media like CNN, MSNBC, etc. So what are your thoughts? Put your comments down below. Please subscribe. Thank you for your support. See now I have been demonetized by YouTube, I'm on Patreon, BitTute, and also PayPal. And please stay safe. I'll talk to you later. God bless you all. Bye.\n",

He knows that Jews use babies as sex toys, he was about to break, he knew the risk he would take, lighting up the Jews is never a mistake, and bushing at squirrel hill. The Jews were alive, still, he wasn't going to stand for any day, but he was still a little bit more than he did.

The Jews were alive, still, he wasn't going to stand for any Jewish shell, they've been bringing in invaders, Robert couldn't wait till later, he knew not killing the kikes would make him a race straighter. Fuck your optics, put the Jewish heads on sticks, rabbi Shlomo won't be able to get his last licks, no more sucking baby cocks, give the pedophiles a shot, with a gift from your family of glocks, his name was Robert Thouers, giving the Jews a fucking shower, killing a dozen and half an hour, you think he was wrong. You can suck my done, that's what the Jews get for knocking down the twin towers, lighting up the tree of life, we can care less about your Jewish wife and fuck up the kikes with our bowie knives. Its Robert Thouers, his hour bad boy, killing Jews brings me eternal joy, lighting them up, he ain't a soy boy, no more invaders, we won't wait till later, it's hard to carry Jews with the Ausch for Celebator, why was there a sucker field and why was there a pool, why did Anzdairi not match her work from school. The idea that the Jews all die sounds pretty damn cool, a fine ballpoint pen wasn't made till 1951, a futuristic pen sounds like a lot of fun. It turns out, the diary was made by Meyer Levin, those lying Jews don't have a chance at heaven, and I swear when the dick comes we'll feel more than 11.

Now you take a nigger, he ain't nobody's food, he doesn't buy any gasoline to drive his kids to school. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. My government has gone crazy, I'd change things if I could, if I was only a nigger, I could afford to live in a white neighborhood. Oh the things that I could do, if I was black and hell bent, I could send my kids to college and he wouldn't cost me one damn cent. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. The wife and I were down on our look, we were really getting uptight, they set up to well for our office, you ain't black you're white. Oh how I've tried to get a job, or the plumber I had with pride, the post office man laughed and said, you're not dark enough to even qualify, damn I wish I was a nigger. I took a civil service exam and passed it without shame, a nigger took one next to me and he couldn't even write his own name. The nigger he got to job, now he's got him a top brass, he couldn't qualify for a trash truck. I'm out on the street on my ass, damn I wish I was a nigger. If I was a Jesse Jackson, I'd be nobody's slob, wearing $500 suits, that nigger hasn't even got a job. If I was Jackson Brown, I could set back and relax and if elected president could paint the White House black, damn I wish I was a nigger. If I was a jigger boot, I could find me my roots with a Afro big as a watermelon and a pair of white disco boots. If I was only dark, I could stand tall in this life, I could eat howl the hole, just me and my white wife, damn I wish I was a nigger. Things are supposed to be segregated, but things are a little off key, I've never seen a white man head of the NAACP. It ain't that I don't like a nigger. If I've rubbed you wrong by chance, take a look at that missile tow, hanging on the seat of my pants, damn I wish I was a nigger. If I was a kinky top, I could be a Martin Luther King, I'd have me a vision on a mountain top, my song the whole world would sing. I could have me a peace march on the streets of Memphis, Tennessee, I could tear up the hole damn city and the police wouldn't dare stop me, damn I wish I was a nigger. A lot of things in life I know, but one thing I can't figure, why a nigger can call me a hunky and I can't call a nigger a nigger. If I was a jungle bunny, I could ring a golden bell, I could be a Muhammad Ali and be loved by Howard Cozale, damn I wish I was a nigger. If I was a U-Bangie, seven foot tall and lean, I could be a famous player on a Washington basketball team. If I was only chocolate brown, I could have me some turn of greens, up off some fat in watermelon, chitlins, and a pot of butter beans, damn I wish I was a nigger. No more Luther King was buried in Washington with class, faced down in his box so the politicians could kiss his ass. I guess it's just politics and it sure gets my goat. Kiss assing with a nigger just to get his vote, damn I wish I was a nigger. If I was only a burr head, I'd live hound a hill, selling cocaine in prostitutes and popping all kinds of pills. I'd take the NAACP, they can march and raise all kinds of hell, let the KKK start to move and they'll all wind up in jail. Damn I wish I was a nigger. I dreamed my life was over, I heard St. Peter say, today we're taking only niggers, you've got to go the other way. Then I heard the devil, he said I heard what Peter had to say, but I'm sorry to tell you his son, today in hell his nigger day, damn don't you wish you were a nigger. I'm going back to the heels of Arkansas where they don't have those knocked down one side in nigger peace marches, protesters, welfare checkrabbers. I'm gonna plant me some turn of greens in a watermelon patch, raise me a hold and a big fat possum. I said yes I am, you mother.\n",

The handwriting has been on the wall, clear and legible. Now we got a muzzie turn in fruits into vegetables. It was a great night. It was a homo-caused, bonafide homicide. The tea lives lost. No pulse just blood on the dance floor. Now the facts are more butt-curd than before. Look here. A Muslim walks into a bar, an order shots for everybody. Hardy hard-hired Annie should have killed more but he was not a straight shooter. Almost makes you want to cry like that the gators incurred. It's a tragedy. Too many faggot's gone away. So instead of Islam they're gonna die from AIDS. If survivors want to feel guilty vans they're prerogative but I really hope they will remain HIV positive. The majority of victims were face-taking loads in the face but this time not from the some had trouble to solve. The false claims false flags on the internet too and amount peace behind it all is guest food. You can't trust the mainstream media undeniable. They're less reliable than wiki media. The dude was a troll and lips took the bait. Now it's gun control. In the poe we say. He said he was ISIS but ISIS never heard of him. He said he had no problem with papers while he murdered them. He said he was had a row with semen in his farts. It's the SJW culture tearing itself apart. A pig seems the main thing. Then this means the heart of pig. The pig's flag. The part leave a muzzle in a bathroom. Let him throw some dogs like shoot maples in a barrel or a shopping cart. 49 baggots and want to. They are having a hard time with this. They want a flame whitey but it's hard to miss. That the shooter was a muslim and a baggot at that. And like most mass shooters he was a Democrat. Pack and ship packings. Like in bags and doors. And the Jews knew as he got a new high school. But that's only cause box crimes and to go unrecord. When I kill a thousand nickers it just isn't reported. I'm killing nickers. I'm killing nickers. I'm killing baggots. I'm killing baggots. I'm killing six. I'm killing six. I'm killing blood slimes who I like to suck and take. 49 baggots and want to. They may be ignorant. Savages. They may be ignorant. Savages. What they work in for me. This is Moonman here. Telling you queers, greasy wet bags and sand niggers to take a long walk off a short pier.

Times are mighty desperate in the heart of Coontown. You can hardly find a fat and healthy cool and all around. But I'm the cool that's been blest with wealth, while a lot of coins around ain't even got good health. There's Coons in town who are hungry as hawks, while I've got quail too feet to my dogs. All about hard, luckful, I don't care because I live the life of a billionaire. I'm living busy, eating pork chops, breezy. Always got money to give my honey. I'm always picking on a spring chicken. Yes, I am living easily, miserably living high. Me and my gals rolled out last night. We hadn't gone far until we got into a fight. A cop said move, but I didn't. Next day I had to say good morning, judge a cop, or said judge that good is a bag. Then I pulled a thousand dollars out of my money bag. I was fighting and costs and the judge looked strange when I handed him a 50 and said keep the change. I'm living easy, eating pork chops, breezy. Always got money to give my honey. I'm always picking on a spring chicken. Yes, I am living easily, miserably living high. Talk about a darky having easy times. I eat the best of foods and drink the best of wines. And when my time comes to leave this pretty earth, I can look up and say I've had my money's worth. I never went to school, that's a fact indeed. And numbers is the only thing that I read. But every day about half past three, I high-risked my food to read the news to me. I'm living easy, eating pork chops, breezy. Always got money to give my honey. I'm always picking on a spring chicken. Yes, I am living easily, miserably living high. I'm living easy, eating pork chops, breezy. Always got money to give my honey.

Taking nigger jokes while he in the room, he gon' laugh hard at me, because he a queen, I'm a queen, top down pants up when I walk. Never call a seal a boss, and not a queen. Boom, it's the elephant in the room. Nah, that's some motherfucking cool. Black's been free since we can got wasted, but some of these nigger still on the plantation. Listen up, Charles Barclay.

TNT made you big, but you wanna rig, now you racking like you never had trouble with these. You just a man in the mob, a real dude's, that's a no-no. Where'd you go, come out the car, that you fucking home home. Saw yo' till a bitch in dressin' and drag. What kind of dumb nigga say, slavery wasn't that bad?

How to make a queen if you wish for a black one, put some change in his pocket and give him a platform. Put him on sketchin' it across that line, but you can shitin' on his people, give him more airtime. Stealing ain't smippin' stuff with that high line. Think my flyer been for our blinds.

The supporters of coons love to talk about how they respect them because the coon have their own mind, or they have their own opinions, or they think I shot at the box. That's a lie. The reason why they support the coon is because they can control the coon. Now some people don't have a problem with me calling these coons. I, first thing they gon' say is, crap in the butt and crap. But let me tell you something. This ain't got nothing to do with me trying to hold another bad person back. I learned to be black people getting the young style of saying, but it's no criticism of the black community. I'll wait your contribution to the black community. And you're flat, you a mother from the coon. If every time coon leaves, you somebody's black. And you take the coon inside, you are a queen. If you fix your mouth to say that we're in the racism and discrimination in a manor like this old coon, man, and snicker, David Clark, who called himself a sheriff in New York, you are a queen. If you are a free ethnicity, a new white, and you support Donald Trump, yes, you are a queen. If you are here, red known the next man, because he hustlin' and y'all doing the same thing, you're not just a coon, you are mother fuckin' black coon. Let me get back into your past, this and that, snicker, Charles Barkley. Look here, Nick, you know how to talk about how you're a slap somebody. I wish you were with your mother fuckin' hands on me. I'm body no fat ass, real talk. This nigga got a real self-hate issue. Fuck Charles Barkley, and the ground he walk on. And if you fuckin' with Charles Barkley, fuck you too. Yes, kid, it's really deep.

It's the triple K-nigger killing OG-Nune man taking a bacon flavored shikon a ko-ran. I'll carve your face like a pumpkin and rip out your guts. I remove your brain but you're a pumpkin with no nut. I'll bite your neck and nigger blood will spill out. It'll go into cauldron full of my brand new niggers. I'll do it and you'll say fun how we know. Take a walk outside Nigger and I'll give you a fright. I'll put you on a lab table. And dissect your body parts create a nigger monster like it's a work of art. In fact, I just did that. I made a nigger's time. He's part Jewish. But that's fine. He's gone a die anyway some time soon. That's enough talk from the moon. Take it nigger's time. My name is nigger's time. Created from a nigger's head and a Jewish spine and a very mixed monster. So I take everything but all your black and neck I shall read my mask. I move and I make me from your interview. I won't stop until it's complete nigger devastation. I'll help him create a pure white garrion nation because blacks are nothing but a nigger's nation. I'll have my master begin the race war by killing nigger's at raping black hordes. My master says that the white shirt went. Being black is simply a sin. The other fuckers out kill all of you fucking spearsuckers. Make sure none of you exist because your top suckers are niggers. Time is here and he's gonna kill you. You know that this is true. Take it master. So whether it's me or the niggers time coming, you better put on your shoes and start running. We hate niggers and we hate Jews and we're gonna come for you. So don't try if your goner got wheel ripped out your eyes and you'll ask why? Your nigger, that's why. The lynching continues on October 31st and nigger blood will quench my thirst. So when you see someone and a ghost has to, it could be a clansman who'll send you to a choon. Nigger's time will come and kill your dune. No doubt for him and the moon. That's right, this is new men and nigger's time signing off. We're goner go kill some niggers and clean our truck off by running into some niggers and paint a rap. You'll all be dead. That's what moon man said.\n",

To get the moons like this, you have to overtake an overexposed shot of the planet Jupiter. And then you get the moons, but the planet is overexposed. So you crop the planet out, then you take low exposures and stack them to get the planet this way. So the planet looks correct, and then you can also see the moons.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_457.mp3:  Hi everybody, my name is Candace Owens and you are watching my vlog series The Myth of the Coon. So foremost why the word coon that is socially unacceptable, why would someone who is African American say the word coon? The first answer is because I can, the second answer is because it's important that I do. To me obviously I believe that the word coon is a myth in the African American community, which actually systematically, words like Uncle Tom and Fum, these words systematically oppress black people, which is quite ironic when said against the fact that the people that champion these phrases tend to think that they are the core of the black involvement and the black movement. To give you guys a current event, a recent example of this in the press is the Colin Kaepernick never ending saga, he did not get resigned for the NFL. Michael Vick came out, not swinging, but just essentially said that if you had any advice for Colin, it would be for him to get a clean cut and to go back to focusing on playing good football rather than politics. Michael Vick was attacked by a bunch of people and he was referred to as an Uncle Tom Arcoon and Colin Kaepernick himself tweeted out of a diagnosis for him saying that he had stock clone syndrome. The insinuation being that he fell in love with his captors, he fell in love with the white people and he was grateful to the white people, which is why he was speaking out against or just giving him suggestions I would ultimately help his career. Getting a haircut and showing up to work without causing any drama is generally good advice. Colin Kaepernick was performing extremely well in the NFL until he decided that he was suddenly offended by the national anthem. I don't think there is a single job in America, whether you are white, black, Spanish, regardless of your race that you can show up in and consistently cause drama and you will not eventually just be ousted. Particularly with taking the sports, people will actually participate and go to sports and spend a lot of money and spend $12 for a hot dog to tune out, to not be involved in politics, to just be involved in the emotion of the sport with absence, any feelings or political affiliation. Bottom line, I think that Michael Vick gave Colin some sounding advice. But once again, the black community, when they see that, they say, oh, you're not one of us, you're one of them. We have to stop doing this because we need to evolve. We have to understand that showing up everywhere angry or showing up everywhere disappointed is not going to get us anywhere in the world or a society that we would like to be. There are a lot of things that I believe in personally that would make me either a coup or an oval tom. The first of them being that I don't support the black lives matter movement whatsoever because the black lives matter movement does not support me. I think that a better title for that moment would be Black deaths matter. They seem to protest, they seem to rage and they seem to ruin and they seem to support violence when a black person dies. What about when a black person lives? There are tons of black people that are trying to better themselves in their community. There are tons of black people that are disadvantaged by the homes that they are born into and just not having money. These groups do not fund them. They will pay for somebody's funeral but they will not pay for somebody's college education. Do that fund these movements like George Soros who has more money than God who has the money to take people straight out of the projects and put them into white community to fund their education and to fund them living in places that are better than the ones they are born. The reason to do so instead, he encourages and he solicits black violence. He encourages us screaming in the street about black deaths and he therefore encourages us getting arrested, ruining our own records and making it impossible once again for us to thrive in society. I think that it is the most hypocritical movement on the planet and absolutely nothing to do with it. From a statistical standpoint, our black people being gunned down more often than white people, absolutely not, the media will try to tell you so because there is more value in black people portraying this stereotype as angry than there is in you actually being educated and understanding the things that our community is actually facing as an enemy. One thing that is the biggest problem in the black community is our support which is so ironic when you think about the fact that we continually support these democratic candidates, our support of planned parenthood which has actually decreased the black population by 34%. Black babies are being slaughtered every single day and yet we stand behind the lines of the people that fund that. They fund a black massacre. There are no black voices standing up and saying this is wrong and if they do sit up and say it's wrong, they are dismissed as an uncle Tom. I'm happy to be an anti-tom to tell you guys a little bit more about what our community needs to do to better themselves. Being starts and ends with education. We cannot better ourselves unless we understand what it is that we are up against. Of course systematically black people were oppressed but of course you cannot just stick your hand out and ask for favors to get over that oppression. The most recent example of that, people that we can look to are Jewish community. The Jewish community had the odds stacked against them after World War II. They were escaping Germany with the clothes on their back and look at where they are in the world right now. They did that by building a community that supported one another. There is no Jewish freeze for an uncle Tom. When somebody in their community made it and thought differently and made it a little further, they encouraged that person. When that person got to the top, they hired from the underground of their communities which is something that as black people we have to learn from. Absolutely. I do not remember the name of the person whose video I watched but he was an African American leader, similar to an Al Sharton. He basically acknowledged the fact that no matter what you do for black people, if you do not marry a black person, then everything you did doesn't count when you are a trader. When people speak to you like this, you need to turn off the TV. As a black community and as a black person, I have daily within my race, I did it outside of my race. Your highest priority as a human being should be to marry someone who thinks like you, to marry someone that will bring you the successes that you desire in your own life and to turn off the absolute garbage that tells you differently. That is the end of my Candace rant about why I do not support Black Lives Matter. Please stay tuned. I will be putting out weekly videos. I guess the term nowadays is weekly vlogs and they will all be entitled the Myth of the Coon. Thank you guys so much for listening and they will all be entitled the Myth of the Coon.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_96.mp3:  four Elk Grove teenagers behind bars tonight. After they were caught on camera, attacking a younger boy on his way home from school. Here in Elk Grove, it's something that we don't expect. Tonight, the victim in the attack is speaking out. Thanks for joining us tonight. I'm Tony Lopez. And I'm Christina Jains, CBS 13, Jennifer McGraws, live at the police department, with a video that helped investigators quickly make an arrest here, Jen. Tony and Christina, that victim is still shaken to the core by Friday's attack. His family only moved to that neighborhood two months ago, a place they thought they'd be safe. They all came up to me and started attacking me. The vicious assault against this 12-year-old boy was caught on a neighbor's home security camera. The victim, who does not want to be identified, was riding his bike home from Toby Johnson Middle School when a car pulled up. The driver came up in front of me, and he pushed me off the bike. And then, do you guys from behind me came up to me and started attacking me? The video shows the older teens knocking him down, tugging at his backpack and stealing his air Jordan sneakers, and cell phone, leaving behind scrapes and bruises. I'm so scared, so I ain't. I ain't able to do signs blocking my face, my arms. The video then turned over to police. The car pulls up, four suspects get out, and viciously attack. This 12-year-old kid just walking home. Neighbors who live on Swan Way say it's common to see kids coming and going to school. You see the children and kids on bikes all the time, skateboards, and there's never been an incident like this that I've heard of. Parents like Mario Gire are shocked. Something like this could happen so close to home. It's not fair. You know, the child could have got hurt and even worse for a pair of shoes. Police say the surveillance video was key in tracking down the suspects who are high school students, 16 and 17 years old. The technology with social media combined can be a powerful tool for not only the community, but for us as law enforcement. These high school suspects now getting a tough lesson in the criminal justice system. When I just start jumping up and down and panicking, you just, you fucking monkey ape.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_68.mp3:  Do you remember when Morgan Freeman said this? We have been attacked. We are. Well, it turned out he was right. We're at war. We're at war with a lying virtue signaling Hollywood elite. We're at war with a hostile and divisive fake news media. We're at war with feminist lies about patriarchy, rape culture and toxic masculinity. We're at war with treasonous western leaders in Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the once-united kingdom. In fact, in every western nation except for the one where we are told the leader is a traitor. He was committed treason against his own people. Donald Trump stands alone in support of Brexit. He stands alone in support of western values. He stands alone in support of democracy. He stands alone in support of the freedom of speech. But this is a brave new world where freedom will not be tolerated. I don't like amputin' chemicals in the water that earn the friggin' frog's game. Do you understand that? I earn the friggin' frog's game. I'm a imp, serious crap. I'm friggin' frog's game. It's not funny. I'm gonna say real slow for you. I'm a imp, strong. The recent arrest, false imprisonment and effective torture of Tommy Robinson, Lauren Southern, being banned from the United Kingdom and being threatened with arrest in Australia for committing the crime of wrong think in believing she was free to speak in a nation in which she actually is free to speak just in Trudeau giving millions of dollars to Islamic terrorists or giving nothing to injured Canadian soldiers. The once-united kingdom locking people up for the crime, unbelievably, of throwing bacon at a mosque, a crime for which ultimately they died. Angela Merkel showing scorn and disdain for the German flag and even greater scorn and disdain for the German people, her loathing of freedom, her loathing of democracy, her contempt for the safety of the German people, her desperation to bring in hostile people from a hostile culture to raise a maze cowardly, sniveling and pathetic refusal to implement the democratic will of the British people, social media platforms shutting down, we're moving and shadow-banging libertarian and conservative voices where anyone who refuses to tow the party line is turned into an orwellian, unperson. Leaders in Western nations taking large sums of money from the Chinese in what could only be described as bribes, skyrocketing national debt and ever-increasing unemployment as a consequence of a series of bad trade deals that appeared to be designed to harm their own people. Failing education systems driven by propaganda and ideology set out to indoctrinate rather than educate the lie of 53 imaginary genders rammed down the throats of the young. Islamic grooming games being allowed to get away with raping thousands of children over a period of decades, the implementation in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand of what amount to virtual blasphemy laws and laws prohibiting free speech in supposedly free nations, Lauren Southern and Stefan Molony being effectively banned from speaking in New Zealand. We are at war. This is an attack. This is an attack on Western culture and Western values. This is an attack on freedom and as we see in the rising body counts in Islamic terror, this is an attack on Western people. But the leaders of this attack are not the Islamists. They are the liars and the throats and the conmen who run our governments. We are at war and our enemy is our treasonous leaders. But sadly they are aided and abetted by far too many of us who have bought the indoctrination and have bought the lies. We are at war and we are losing. Now culture is not going to die with a bang. It's not even going to die with a whimper. It's barely going to make a sound. All we will hear as our culture dies is this. Morons are plotting their own destruction. We are at war.\n",

One ended up in Israel terrorizing Christians and Muslim Palestinians, the other ended up in South Africa terrorizing European Christians there. Here he is with his followers, Winnie Nelson Mandela, beneath a symbol of communism.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_324.mp3:  In New York City formed the Asian hate crime task force after spike in anti-Asian attacks. Okay, now I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen to this task force. They're going to spend it after like about 10 days. Why 10 days? I tell you. I was going to find that all of the attackers as has been the case for the past six months or four that matter at about 75 years, all the racially motivated attack are caused by blacks and some it is sparring, but they're mostly blacks. Let me give you an example of the task force during the Dinkins administration after the Howard Beach fiasco, you know, where they were alleging that there's white kids attacking as blacks. May I think it's the worst president, the worst president, the worst mayor ever by New York city or any country on the face of the earth. He established this task force to catch the racist. They wanted to catch the racist. So what they did, they had this task force, but they did was they had a black cop in civilian clothing, walked through a white neighborhood, you know, with like a backup in the background. So that every time he will be attacked by the black, by the white racist, he will call the backup and arrest those evil white racists. Now in the spirit of political correctness, he had a white cop do the same thing. White cop or cops walk through black neighborhoods in civilian clothing. And then if he was attacked by blacks, right, he would call backup. Well, they had to stop that after that. Now this was supposed to go on for, you know, for months or years, but they had to stop it after only 10 days. And you know why? Do you realize why? I tell you why. Because the white cop was literally, literally, as reported by the Daily News and the New York Post was lit, not the New York Times, by the way. The white cop was literally attacked every 20 minutes by blacks. He was literally attacked toward it. And some of the white cops had to be hospitalized for trauma, for psychological trauma. Okay. Now you're probably saying, well, the black cop must have been attacked every like two seconds. Well, in those 10 days, the black cop was attacked exactly zero, zero times. There were no incidents of white racism. There were only incidents of black racism. As you would expect, because blacks are the most violent, most racist, the biggest haters on the planet. So this thing, you know it's not going to go far. Or maybe times have changed and they throw a couple thousand blacks in prison because they attack Asian and they attack everybody. They really should have a task force on blacks attacking everybody. And I got to tell you, they're going to fill the prison to the roof.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_522.mp3:  Russia has spent the last few years growing its list of Western enemies, but the country's relationship with Israel has only improved. In spite of Russian support for Syria and a long history of tense adversarial relations, Israel and Russia are close geopolitical allies. So why exactly do the two countries love each other? Well, the political and social history of Russia and Israel is actually incredibly unique. Early on in Israel's formation, the Soviet Union was a major supporter of a Jewish state. Allegedly, Russian dictator Joseph Stalin expected the new country to be socialist, and the USSR was even the second country in the world to recognize Israeli sovereignty after the United States. However, this support was not long lasting. In an effort to gain control over the Middle East, Russia funded and armed countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, and others. Meanwhile, the United States provided military and financial support to Israel, creating a de facto adversary to the Soviet Union. And yet, in spite of their political divide, the people of Israel and Russia have seen parallel social development. Due to the Soviet Union's persecution of religion, and in particular, the country's state-sanctioned anti-Semitism, Israel served as a welcoming home for Jewish Russians, known as Refuse Nix. In 1970, a group of Refuse Nix attempted to hijack an airplane in order to escape the Soviet Union. And while they failed, it drew international attention to the fact that conditions within Russia were terrible, and those who wanted to leave weren't allowed to. So throughout the 1970s, Russia allowed hundreds of thousands of Jewish Russians to leave the country, and by 1988, an estimated 160,000 had emigrated to Israel. This mass migration of Jews was known as the 1970 Aliya. Once in Israel, Russians were able to assimilate while introducing their own social norms, including a focus on high culture, such as theater, literature, music, and art. In the Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, opened the country's borders, a second massive wave of Russian Jews came to Israel, close to 1 million over the following decade and a half. There are now more Russian Jews living in Israel than there are in Russia, and Russia is the largest source of international Jews in Israel. This enormous domestic influence of both Jewish culture and Russia and Russian culture in Israel may be the reason that both countries are incredibly sympathetic to each other, in spite of their international disagreements. In the early 2000s, the two populations elected leaders who were outspoken supporters of each other. Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Aurel Sharang. Israel's current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself has family roots in the former Russian Empire. For the past decade, much of Israel's ability to maintain both their sovereignty and avoiding international sanctions has stemmed from broad and equal support from both of the world's 20th century superpowers, the United States and Russia. In fact, the US and Russia, in addition to the United Nations and the European Union, make up the Middle East Quartet, which is a collection of national bodies working to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. On the one hand, Russia has been working to support the Syrian regime, which has repeatedly attempted to destroy Israel. Meanwhile, Israel stands opposed to Iran, Russia's longtime ally. And yet, the two countries have cultures and politics that are so deeply intertwined that their social bond is able to overcome any military divisiveness. Iran and Israel have been opposed for decades. To learn about why the two hate each other, despite sharing allies, watch this video right here. Thanks for checking out now this world.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_536.mp3:  Carle, good morning to you. You know, this is really an end of an era because Sheldon Adelson was the last of the casino moguls on the Las Vegas strip, the last founder of a mega brand. At 87, he was still the decision maker for this company. He died last night of non-Hochkins, Lymphoma, which he battled for some time. It had taken him off multiple earnings calls, though not out of the office throughout the last couple years. His legacy profound. Every market he touched, he changed. Adelson's impact on Macau, his vision for Singapore, his dreams for Las Vegas, he leaves his mark on every integrated resort in every destination. He had a deep abiding love for Israel. He donated generously to conservative politics there and smashed records for political donations in U.S. politics. In fact, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sheldon Adelson and his wife were the single largest political donors of the 2020 election cycle, giving $218 million to Republican or conservative groups. They had donated more than 100 million in the 2018 midterms, and in the 2016 presidential election, they were Trump's biggest donors. Sheldon Adelson had a massive impact on U.S. politics. All of that, of course, was extraneous to the people who worked for him. Many of his executive team had been with him for decades. A lot of communications Ron Rees told me, today's a day when the Housekeepers are crying over the death of Mr. Adelson. He was perceived as anti-union, but executive has pointed out what he paid and he offered for benefits, exceeded what unions secured for those workers. And throughout the pandemic, Las Vegas stands has not laid off any of its 50,000 employees globally, which really, I think, stands out not just in the casino industry, but in business in general. Last Wednesday, the company announced Adelson would take medical leave. It was an indication of how seriously his health was declining. The board named Rob Goldstein, interim chairman and CEO, signaling its thoughts about the potential future leadership here. I also want to mention that the CFO, Patrick Dumont, is Sheldon's son-in-law, and the family retains majority share. Sheldon Adelson's funeral will be held. I'm told almost immediately in Israel with a memorial plan for a later date in Las Vegas carl. Can Tessa any clues as to whether or not or how the company's direction or focus might change? You know, after he announced medical leave last week, we already saw analysts speculating about whether Rob Goldstein would entertain the idea of Las Vegas stands breaking into sports gambling. Remember, Sheldon Adelson was a very staunch opponent of internet gambling. He spent a lot of money trying to fight it. And we may see some departure on that because right now, all the businesses that Las Vegas stands engage in these integrated resorts, those have all been shut down in the pandemic where, with internet gambling, of course, that can stay up and running, even if that physical casinos are locked down. We'll have to wait and see if that comes through to fruition. Shepard Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube.\n",

I went in the store and bought a dozen eggs, and all of the eggs was written a lady's name in her address. And underneath it said, please lie. Did you lie? No. As I opened the egg, I knew by this time that she must be a very old lady. Let's take a good look at this. Anybody, either that could be wild or dark, But yearg formidable, a shy boy, who is the girl in disguise? If you do, you know just what she is. Go ahead and sweep the seed on the plate. Don't laugh. By going in the store! What a minored lady she must see. And raise your hand around.\n",

Dr. Fauci, thank you so much for taking the time out. I have so many questions to ask you as you can imagine, but first off, it's been 24 hours since you got the Moderna vaccine. How are you feeling? Any side effects? Is your arm sore? Well, I actually feel quite good. I do have a little bit of a sore arm. After the vaccination, it was about maybe six to eight hours. I felt absolutely nothing and then towards the late afternoon, I started to get soreness in the arm. This is very typical of vaccinations. The same thing happened with other non-COVID vaccines that I've had over the years. I felt a little bit achy, but nothing to be bothering or distracting me. Went to bed last night, had a good night's sleep, woke up this morning. The only thing I have is just a little bit of a soreness in the arm. Otherwise, I'm doing really well.\n",

Jesus paid the way to return a life It's beyond the grave God bless the white grace And I'm proud to be a joy in the way I am no longer free and I won't forget the gennicide that you wish it to be But Lushie, it's time to wake up, Jacob's sons, Jesus paid the way to return a life It's beyond the grave God bless the white grace And I'm proud to be an area though I am no longer free and I won't forget the puppy eyes My children gave to me and say had to stand up next to me as bullets came our way But eternal life it's beyond the grave Through your way we are safe\n",

That's not an eight-year-old's question. That's my question. I want to know, but I think I know. Because we didn't go there and that's the way it happened. And if it didn't happen, it's nice to know why it didn't happen. So in the future, if we want to keep doing something, we need to know why something stopped in the past that we wanted to keep going. Money is a good thing. If you want to buy new things, new rockets, instead of keeping doing the same thing over, then it's going to cost more money. And other things need more money, too.

You know, when we toured around the world after we came back, the most fascinating observation was signs that said, we did it. Not just us, not just America, but we, the world, different country. They felt like they were part of what we were able to do. And that made us feel very good. Why has nobody been to the morning such a long time? Because we didn't go there.

I found myself back in my prayer room. I found the spirit, very disturbed. By everybody's prepared for the final four March madness, things that ran into newspapers have disturbed me. I'm trying to figure out if Black Lives really matter than in Chicago alone the murder rate of sort, 72% in 2016. 88% in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year. I'm trying to ask the question if, if, to the organization of Black Lives, if they really matter, then why not riot now? There was 141 murders this year. 82 murders last year at the same time. I've, I'm trying to figure out in my mind why no one is playing attention to Black men killing Black men. Why we always find ourselves has the victims. And now we have the separation once again that we're being victimized because of one bad white cop, two bad white cops, three bad white cops, kill on the young Black brother. But every day we have Black on Black crime killing each other. Police in Chicago reported 677 Jews this year. Last year it was 359. March murder rate rose by 29%. But we're not rioting in the streets when Black on Black crime are killing each other. I'm trying to figure out how, how the month of March there's more murders in the month of March in Chicago than there are days in the month, 45 murders in the month of Chicago. There was 271 Jews incidents. I'm trying to stop the access one simple thing. When will we appreciate who we are? When will our skin color start paying attention to our own skin color? When will we stop crying that Black lives matter? Because God says I am alpha and omega. I am creator of all and all come up under me with my spirit. Which means color means nothing. I am king. I will live this king. But we have found our way distracted. We found our way distracted because things we're not paying attention to. The murders in 2015 and 2016, just the comparison to Chicago should be sad enough. 2015, there was 34 murders. 2016, that was 45. From January 1st to March 31st, there was 82 murders in 2015. There was 141 in 2016. Let's just talk about the shootings. The shootings in 2015, there was 179. 2016, there was 271. January 1st to March 31st, the shootings alone, 2015, there was 359. 2016, there was 677. The shooting victims in 2015, it was 204. In 2016, it's 319. From January 1st to March 31st, it was 411 in 2015. The 677 murders in 2016. And I'm trying to hack what's the problem. I was hacked if I was an elected official. What would I do to stop some of this violence? I would put barrels on each corner. I would give you 30 days to drop all illegal weapons in these barrels. And if you found yourself going outside of that, the moment I found you with him, that's 25 years. mandatory. There's no more having conversations because what's starting to happen now is we're starting to confuse our kids. Our kids don't know which way to walk the streets. We got babies in Baltimore being shot in the middle of the streets. They're on the front porch and they're being shot. We got a family of five to six sitting in the backyard having a barbecue. And the whole entire family gets executed. But we keep screaming black lives matter. It's a really matter. Then let's do ourselves a favor. Let's stop killing black folks. Let's take it way back to when we once understood what slavery was all about. Slavery was about togetherness and I understand that we must overcome together. Not that we must separate ourselves to highlight our skin color. If you want to highlight our skin color, highlight the people that's doing the successful things in the communities that we should be highlighting. All athletics, athletics come a dime a dozen. But the impact of your journey and the things that we supposed to be doing. You supposed to be leaving an impact to change people's lives. One day God won't act how many super balls I've won, how many tackles I've made, how many interceptions I have. You will ask the simple question, how many lives have I changed? All I comfort zone must be disturbed. We got music now that kids can't listen to what their parents. We got radio and art shows that's showing things that kids have a way. Social media has took us way beyond what we supposed to be. We've done the long term thinking in our minds. We've led kids now dictate what they can do and who they can be and what they will ultimately be. I found myself disturbed. Whether I'm right or wrong, there's facts. There's numbers. Men and women lie. But numbers don't. Numbers don't lie. And what's going on in Chicago right now. If you write music, change your thought process, change your language. Stop insulting women. We all got our struggles. There's nothing about me that's perfect. I'm a struggling man every day of my life to walk the right path. I haven't figured it all out yet. But I figured out enough to say that there's something and I'm supposed to pass along. That don't go through my same struggles. Let's write something different. Let's give these lost children something to really envision. I cried today to say I'm not a perfect man. And I have my failures just like anyone else. But I guess the question is, are you helping or you serving? You can help anybody. You can give your money away to help any calls. But to serve. To serve. You must come out of your comfort zone. There's too many brothers killing each other. And brothers, if I had one message for you man, stop and check the pulse of the person before you pull a trick. And realize that they are alive. And everybody you hurt, you will be accounted for. Man, I'm talking about, I'm man foolish people on social media, the things that they say that's pure ignorance. Evil exists. Social media has become the devil's playhouse. Because it has foolish ignorant people who can hide behind captions of children and pictures and funny things. And insult people who's actually doing something. But one day we will all be held accountable. And brothers, if nobody else wants stream to you, I'm a stream to you. I know Black Lives Matter. Because I'm a Black man. But man, stop killing each other. Man, we got to put these guns down to the sky call. Baltimore Miami. Man, that ain't that hard man. Man, you got to be okay. We're earning the right living man. He's supposed to be easy. Man's days on this earth will be short and filled with trouble. But right now man, we, we're losing the battle. A third of the African-American population is behind bars. 50% are behind bars because they took the life of another Black man. Sooner or later, Black man. If we don't change what we're doing, now only will our kids not have a future. But we might find ourselves extinct. Listen to your boys and girls, I got something for you. Don't worry about getting no Black man a little girl. Don't worry about getting no Black woman a little boy. When you go up, don't worry about your kids. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to do is do some girls with white folks. And a white folks love you. If they love you, you'll be our right child. You'll be with God. Corn watch.

Only attracted to things that'll bring them money overseas. Yeah, we blowing up sand niggers, but we still got Muslims here live in. In the USA, the bunch of gays, we need to stop them join the KKK. But if you only have love for the Nglitz, then you only leave space to procreate. And to procreate only generates more niggers. And when you hate them we can finally loathe them into a crate. Yeah, madness is what you demonstrate. And that's exactly how niggers work and operate man. These spearchuggers can't even walk straight. Hey control of your slaves and stop their heart rate. Let niggers next gyrate to 180 degrees. Moo-moong-moong-kill-in, niggers dying. Spicks hurt, and you hear them crying. Can you make those niggers shriek? As you dump them in the creek? Fear of fear of fear of help us. Send some napalm from the blood. Cause blacks got me, got me questioning. Where is my gun? Where is my gun? Where is my gun? My gun, my gun. It just ain't the same. Old ways have changed. New days are strange blacks on dance. Lays of love and peace are so strong. Why are there filthy porch monkeys that don't belong? Triple K-dropping bombs, chemical gasses fill in lungs and little kikes. With all these niggers that need to be hung, so ask yourself where did we go wrong? So I could ask myself really what is going on? In this world that we live in and lefties keep on given in, making wrong decisions, letting those goat fuckers in, and sand niggers kill each other, rate their own brothers, and invasion is going on and we aren't doing anything about it. Burn these Jews, sweep the remains, under the rug. If you run out of bullets then they keep coming to mind. Where's my gun? Come on. Where's my bullets? Come on. Where's my clan? Come on, remember Kitsain for the floating teeth. Burn them killin', niggers die. Spicks hurt, and you hear them cryin', can you make those niggers shriek? As you dump them in the creek? Fear of fear of fear of help us. Send some napon from the book. Cause blacks got me, got me questionin'. Where is my gun? Where is my gun? Where is my gun? Where is my gun? I feel the weight of the spicks climbing my wall. I got a hold of her, crush her head with a bowler. Most of us only care about nigger killing, bring back the camps everyone needs red pilling. Wrong information always shown by the media. Positive images coming from Syria. Letting in Muslims faster than bacteria. Kits should shoot muzzies in a school cafeteria. No, whatever happened to the values of Hitler, whatever happened to the burning of kikes. Instead of spreading gas, we're spreading feaving Jews, lack of understanding, leading us away from our true goal. Fear of fear of fear of help us. Send some napon from the book. Cause burnt chips got me, got me questionin'. Where is my gun? Sing with me, one world, one world, and some things wrong with it. We've gone to let these sub-humans ruin this planet. Niggers can't even grow a carrot, yet, we only got one world don't fuck it up. That's all we got.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_269.mp3:  King Koon, we will raise the Negro to prominence in sports and entertainment to make them appear as suitable mates for the white woman. This is a paraphrase of Israel Cohen's racial program to the 20th century, published in the early 1900s, which sets out a plan for the mongrelization of the white race through the intermixture of cons, through the glorification of the Negro as a celebrity figure. Thus, the lowly savage of darkest Africa has transposed into a King Koon figure and the gullible white population, especially the women, given their emotional mind, are conscripted into this mongrelization protocol, volunteering their daughters and selves as sacrificial gifts on the altar of egalitarian secular humanism, which has become established through the propaganda ministry as a new religion, any questioning of which becomes sin and sacrilege. The heresy of postmodernity, progress, it is called, this downward spiral trend of the subtle and gradual genocide and displacement of one's own kind with sub-IQ savages. The King Koon draped in golden jewels as a modern voodoo priest, a king Solomon, as put forth as a hero figure, a hypermasculine ubermenge, who constitutes the embodiment of virility thereby increasing the probability of his appeal to the naïve and brainwashed white masses. The males wanting to emulate this figure, the females to fornicate with him, such as the intention of a Jewish mod manipulator who uses his system of illusion to create the reality of the desirability of what was only just a few decades ago looked upon as a lowly creature, only slightly elevated from the brute and in fact debated as to whether he was not either the missing lake or an amalgam of beast and man, which ladders probably the reality from a bio-entropological standpoint. Portraying such a creature as the height of masculinity devolves masculinity and humanity to the level of a beast, which is the intention of the Jew to create their mongrelized and debased product of mixture, which would so that they believe in their utopian fantasizing, control the entire world for themselves and enslave all others in their tyranny. The transposition of values here in consists of the negro, former brute, being elevated over the status of a white male, former inventor and creator, and the latter being demoted to the level of a wiggerized slave, useful only as a tool to be dispensed with once used up in its productive capacity. The end of its life force is a human battery to be done away with economically, replacement in occupation with non-whites and physically, through the alopathic genocide system. Thus the white female, though instinctively gravitating toward their own kind as per natural inclinations, perversely shuns her own people through their having been stripped of their status as a valuable commodity and her economic worldview, libidinal economy and social economics. The prudential calculus of decision making on the basis of resource acquisition and provision, i.e. exploitation of man as a resource provider and status object. Given that the new normal socially engineered by the Jew is that the non-whites is giving everything under the Jew, of course, first among equals, the white male is looked upon as of subordinate status, and thus is cut out of the mating game thereby reducing the white birth rate and enabling the Jew to gain greater power and advantage as he hides behind his non-white fronts in the seats of power and claims of status of a humanitarian, a philanthropist who simply wants to give a non-whites a chance. A chance to rape and a chance to create Mongol offspring and to ruin the women of the white race who is naïvely leads them to follow the way of all flesh. Whatever the Jew and his media portrays is socially acceptable, creating a new reality out of the old, reifying his ideals, the women being collectivists and replicating slash peridine, whatever the party line or more as of society happens to be at one moment or another, follow the crowd off the cliff and so long as they are not singled out as an outsider, eagerly to go to their own destruction through the destruction of their family line. The white male has now been debased to the level of the brute, a worker or a vagrant, an outcast who has no entitlement to be represented in his own ancestral territory. Of course, this will be construed as complaining to speak of the realities of life, but is an adequate representation of fact, no mere opinion, and so far as the regime exists, this program of mobilization will exist, and the process through which it is affected, the means to its realization will also exist. The solution is simply to detach oneself from the controlled system propaganda and to make a counter-strike of anti-system propaganda, of rassan hygiene or racial purity in place of rassan and tartum or racial degeneration, to counter the Jews moves in the game of chess between darkness and light, and this through the propounding a traditionalist ethics and ideology which resurrects Allah-Lazurus, the stability of the kid culture and racial group, who only a few, if not only a single decade ago, was a much healthier world with people who actually had a consciousness which rejected the rot of rassan and tartum and understood its corrupting influence. However, what led us to the demographic was a relentless demoralization protocol of the Jew which was used as a mechanism of eroding the healthy instincts of the white population. At this point there still exists the establishment of the Mongol as hero or anti-hero being in doubt with the supreme right to pontificate as a moral superior and to imply the immorality of the white population. However, the scales on the eyes of the broad masses are falling away and they no longer exalt to such an extent as they previously did the accountable savage of darkest Africa as their primitive superman. No longer do the paintings of go-gen of brown tropical females or the bleeding and jarring cacophony of jazz music in a rap appeal to the sensibilities of the broad masses. For they are listening to the call of the blood memory which awakens in their consciousness and understanding of their traditions and identity enabling them to break free of the mold of the Zog Matrix and its anti-white protocols.\n",

Dead nigger child glad you did and get the chance to live a while. Your race does not stand a chance when the moon is on the prowl. Hush now niggers I don't want to hear you cry. Just shut up and die. 277 dead niggers in KFC and counting. Shot some trophy spooks to get stuffed and mouted. No plan to stop till every shit skin is dead and accounted for. Only option I have is to win the race war. Watching nigger bodies drop onto the floor gives me motivation. To go kill some more. Killing niggers is my favorite sport. It's up to me to make sure the white race does not fall short. I am the white man's last resort. Come out and show the clan some support. We are the last of our breed. Time to make niggers bleed. And end Jewish breed. Black blood spills all on the concrete. Triple came up the a rolling through your city. Like a fleet. Niggers to yourself a favor. Surrender and accept defeat the moon can't be beat. Sending black babies into eternal sleep a pure white race is what I seek. A world with no niggers picks or choose don't forget to include erupts to. The eradication of inferior races is long overdue. The white man will push on through after all we have the highest IQ. Turning niggers brains into stew is what we do it's nothing new. I am in the hood killing niggers. See a little nigglet in my way I am pulling my trigger. Dead niggered child glad you didn't get the chance to live a while your race does not stand a chance when the moon is on the prowl. Push now niggers I don't want to hear you cry just shut up and die. 550 dead niggers in KFC and counting got to keep the death toll rising. The black population is surely downsizing. I will kill every spook there is no compromising. I get in the zone I am in a trans-i-fine black death rather mesmo rising no use trying to escape I will set a trap using KFC as bait. Overweight niggers are the best to emulate the moon is full of hate only find a white man great lock you niggers up and cages ship you to a zoo you fucking ape you stink and your skins the same color as poo. Make your regret running into the moon crew blow your brains out now I got nigger residue all over my new suit curb stomp you blacks come with my steel to boot when my leg gets tired my block I will shoot my bullets are en route for your chest dead blacks is what I find best whites will be the only ones left only way for the human race to progress niggered blood makes a big mess but it's worth it for white success lights are the best it's no contest the moon will leave you dead like the rest the nigger race I will suppress I am in the hood killing niggers see a little niggered in my way I am pulling my trigger dead niggered child glad you didn't get the chance to live a while your race does not stand a chance when the moon is on the prow push now niggers I don't want to hear you cry just shut up and die 1000 dead niggers in KFC and counting if this rate the race won't last a while the whites have won by a mile burning dead niggers in a pile this truly does make me smile cleansing this earth is worthwhile giving hope to future generations creating a white only nation\n",

He's a 31-time convicted criminal. No! No! Just cause your auntie's cousin's daughter's friend posted a fake paragraph from the RTE on Facebook. Doesn't make it reliable. It doesn't give you a civilian the right to determine whether or not somebody deserves to die. No matter how many people he threatened, no matter how many people he injured, the only person who is allowed to decide between the life and death of a so-called criminal is a judge. Not to mention the death penalty doesn't exist in this country. So please, for your sake to avoid future embarrassment, every single racist word that comes out of your mouth should be backed up by stats and facts.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_533.mp3:  Thousands of government-sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities, and military bases around our nation. The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body. While most of the tests were ethical by any standards, some were unethical, not only by the day standards, but by the standards of the time in which they were conducted. They failed both the test of our national values and the test of humanity. The breathtaking advances in science and technology demand that we always keep our ethical watch-like burning. No matter how rapid the pace of change, it can never outrun our core convictions. Form consent means your doctor tells you the risk of the treatment you were about to undergo. In too many cases, informed consent was withheld. Americans were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being done to them. The deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and the American people as a whole. For these experiments, we're kept secret. Do you know why they've got my team decoding the entirety of human thought? Yeah, so I can tweet without a keyboard. Implanting. That's the end game. Look how are the implant thoughts into a person, a group, an entire population. The salad to the world is the power to communicate and then they'll have complete power to control. The CIA won't need to stage a coup to rig an election across the planet. How they could turn any one of us into an undercover assassin whenever they wanted and they would do it all from a computer and a lab right here. Matthew's live. They've been testing on humans for months. They were stuck and we just unlocked it all for them. There's too much power. Does this work? Everything that we're doing, this is the end of freedom. The movie The Matrix was just a tale of science fiction, yes, but it is beginning to look more like a documentary every day. Now some may scoff at this idea and say, you're just fear mongering. It's not going to happen. You conspiracy theory nut. Well, I may be a nut. But there is no conspiracy when the information is made public to you. That's just you not being aware of it. So we are going to take a closer look at this because right now something is happening that you may not be aware of. A sentient simulation of our world in real time. No, this is not a video game, folks. But for those who think it is, I have a question. Are you ready? Player one? The true control grid is this technology, voice to stars, high-wind behavior manipulation technology, and it can all be done for both of you. The Bayhavid Division focuses solely on developing the technology for use by the military, government agencies, law enforcement agencies, and force government. And this technology at that point when it is nationwide will be used by automated computer, super computer software programming. That will manipulate the emotions of the behavior of a bunch of everybody in the United States of America. And it can all be done for both of you. It sounds so futuristic. It sounds crazy. Like video phone calls or pocket-sized computers or the government watching all of us all the time. Get ready for the future in Paris. Paris is a real risk that you are going to be top a full-blown 24-something targeted individual. You might want to start watching, but you think. I want to start. Here, first of all, this thing I would not like to discuss is the reason why I can sell this technology, in Alberta, and directly using this technology to multi-power for our lives, a people plagued by dehumanization, boteliness and violence, dramatic, but we are losing control of our technology and our lives. You asked why I picked you. I didn't. You did. The surveillance of experience means you've been selected. A term which will mean more to you is to learn about how the modern SIGAN system works. For now, know that everybody across every purchasing make, every calling a dial, every cell phone call you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site your visit, subject money type and packet you route is in the hands of a system whose name is reached as unlimited, but whose safeguard are not. Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well aware of the threat that unrestricted secret police pose for democracy. This is a story if you but you can tell. Apparently and historically, oppose the secret societies, the secret oaths and the secret proceedings. This is the story of a 30 year search by US intelligence agencies to perfect mind control. Some of those engaged in that search have agreed to talk about it for the first time. One said, I think every last one of us felt sorry to attempt this kind of thing. We knew we were crossing the line. The search would be endless. From brothels, an agent says, we learned a lot about human nature in the bedroom. To the mystical rights of a magical mushroom ceremony performed by an Indian shaman. To a Spanish mole right, the bullies had electrodes implanted in the brain and is controlled by a scientist. There would be vectors. One intelligence agency tried to peel this man's mind back to reveal its deepest secrets. This man worked on some of these programs. He would write of his work. It was fun, fun, fun. This is the story of a search for mind control. The reason I keep coming back to MK Ultra that is surrounding programs is because the more I research, the more I realize that we are living in the very product of that program today. How do you look around the more obvious it will become that the public wasn't told anything about the real aims and objectives of the CIA's. Really, they call it a mind control research program, but it was really just a control research program. Mind, behavior, individual, society, global. When the revelations came out in the 70s, they dazzled the public with tales of mentoring candidates and spy versus spy and Korean brainwashing techniques. They purposefully flown all their dirty laundry around salacious tales of prostitute halfway houses and LSD being administered to unwitting people just to see what would happen. But the whole revelation of the MK Ultra program is pretty much a joke. It would take over 100 books and dozens upon dozens of documents to spell it all out for you in my new detail. But the technocratic cybernetic new world order that's unfolding all around us right now has always been about total world domination. And it connects to every other conspiracy you can possibly think of. And when you really start to research just what's been declassified, just the information that's out there. When you read the documents yourself and you start really looking through the books and the writings of some of these people, and you realize all of this, it's pretty clear that this is one of the biggest threats that we actually face today. Behind all the stuff they tell you in the media, behind all the other stuff that's going on that they flash in front of your face to distract you, this is a serious situation. 2013 to 2014, new centres working on cybernetic technologies for the development of radical life extension rise. The race for immortality starts. 2015 to 2020, the avatar is created, a robotic human copy controlled by thought far brain computer interface. It becomes as popular as a car in Russia and in the world appear in testing mode several breakthrough projects. Android robots to replace people in manufacturing tasks. Android robot servants for every home. Thought controlled avatars to provide telepresence in any place of the world and abolish the need for business trips. Flying cars. Thought driven mobile communications built into the body or sprayed onto the skin. 2020 to 2025, an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment is created. The brain is transplanted into an avatar B. With avatar B, man receives new expanded life. 2025, the new generation of avatars provides complete transmission of sensations from all five sensory robot organs to the operator. 2030 to 2035, rebrain. The colossal project of brain reverse engineering is implemented. World science comes very close to understanding the principles of consciousness. 2035, the first successful attempt to transfer one's personality to an alternative carrier. The epoch of cybernetic immortality begins. 2040 to 2050, bodies made of nanorobots that can take any shape, arise alongside hologram bodies. 2045 to 2050, drastic changes in social structure and in scientific and technological development. All the prerequisites for space expansion are established. For the man of the future, war and violence are unacceptable. The main priority of his development is spiritual self-improvement. A new era dawns. The era of neo-humanity. A group of scientists say we are closer than ever to creating technology which can emerge with human biology in order to access the cloud in real time. Confused? Well, our teeth, virtual blevings is here and has all the details. Can you imagine technology that is so advanced, it could provide you with instant access to the world's knowledge and artificial intelligence as soon as you think of a specific topic? Neural nano-bibotics may be developed to enable a safe, secure, instantaneous, real-time interface between the human brain and both biological and non-biological computing systems. This level of technology could include brain-to-brain interfaces, brain-to-computer interfaces, and specifically brain-to-cloud interfaces. Technology linking the brain to the cloud could drastically alter the state of communications between humans and machines. So in order for this to become possible, the study noted that data transfer between living human brains and the cloud would likely require the use of supercomputers with artificial intelligence algorithms. The senior author of the study noted that once inside the brain the devices would then wirelessly transmit and code information to and from a cloud-based supercomputer network for real-time brain-state monitoring and data extraction. The connections will be start to be made between artificial intelligence and the human brain. And the human brain will be connected to what he calls the cloud. Another name for this is the smart grid. Basically, to artificial intelligence. As time passes, artificial intelligence will be more and more of human thinking and human perception until basically it's the totality of human thinking and human perception. At which point we won't be human anymore in terms of the consciousness processes we are using today. We will be artificial intelligence. And this is the assimilation I'm talking about. If you are connecting the human mind to a grid, a global technological grid, that grid can be centrally controlled. It will take at the percent of point very, very few people to run it and even fewer to decide how it's run. It's the stuff of a Hollywood movie but a group of veterans has filed a lawsuit against the CIA and US Army claiming that the government planted remote control devices in their brains. The claims relate to a government program at the US Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland where scientists tested hundreds of chemical and biological substances on at least 7800 servicemen. So could this really be happening? We'll be joining me to help discuss this as Dr. Colin Ross, president of the Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma. Dr. Ross, tell me, is this really happening? Did the government really take part in mind control experiments on soldiers? What kind of stories have you heard from the survivors of these experiments? I know you've had access to thousands of documents from the CIA. Well, it's just like you just said, there's two kind of streams of information. There are stories from survivors and then there's the documents. So if I go to the documents first, they're very, very detailed, 15,000 pages plus and we're starting back in 1950 with projects called Artichoke and Bluebird which were then rolled over into MK Ultra, which in turn was rolled over to MK Search and then all the documents stopped in 1973. So in that era of 50 to 73, there's a whole host of different types of mind control experiments, hypnosis, LSD, special interrogation chambers and brain electrode implants. And so there's projects in the CIA documents and in Army records where electrodes are put into dolphins and the dolphins are directed by remote transmitter to deliver a bomb to a target. And there's a discussion of similar technology and cats and other animals. There's research funded by the Office of Naval Research published in mainstream journals where electrodes are put in the brains of cats, dogs and their behaviors controlled and even human beings at Harvard and Yale. So this is absolutely documented fact. So tell me how commonplace this was. Is this are we talking about one program that took place decades ago or do you think it's happening more often than that? And if so, how could it be so secretive? I mean most people would think this can't be true. This is a stuff, this is stuff out of a movie. Right. It was not just one program back in the 50s, 60s, 70s. It was Harvard, Yale, Tulane, UCLA. So we know there was more than one university involved, more than one branch of the military, more than one program for a fact. What's going on currently, of course, is all classified. People tell you stories about it, but I can't actually prove that it's happening today. I'm certain that it is why I can't prove it. Dr. Robert Dunham put together the technology that allows the government to transmit thoughts and voices into the heads of Americans. Dr. Robert Dunham. First question for you, what's negative about what you've done? I've empowered the dark side by some of my work. And what do you mean by that? Technology is neutral. It can be used for good or evil. I've worked on projects for the CIA, Justice Department Department of Defense. Is this the stuff voices in the head and things like that? Yes. We've run into a few people that claim they got voices in their heads. They sleep inside tinfoil boxes. They do a lot of crazy things, it seems. But when they talked us, they seemed totally normal. He seemed totally sane. Are these people crazy or is the government doing this to them? The government is doing this to them. He's not even bothering to hide it. They're called Voice of God Weapons. So you know for a fact that these weapons that you worked on, they're being used domestically today? Absolutely. There is a very real risk that you are going to become a full blown 24-7-parketed individual. And this technology at that point, when it is nationwide, will be used by automated computer, super computer software programming. That will manipulate the emotions and the behavior and the thoughts of everybody in the United States of America. And it can all be done remotely. It's very much like the microchip kind of tracking the new world order, this entire control grid that's supposed to be rolled out against the American people someday. And I'm here to tell you that it's already here. There isn't going to come a day where there's troops in the streets and tanks rolling down your neighborhood and riot gear and all this stuff. We might have isolated incidents like that. It might get that like that every once in a while. But the true control grid is this technology. Voice to skull, hive mind, behavior manipulation technology. And it can all be done remotely. It can be done simply by targeting you with the frequency, logging into the resident frequency, your DNA and your bind. And in that manner, it's completely track-traced and controlled here on 24 hours a day. So what we're talking about here is total technological control and weight. I don't think the average of oxygen is dangerous. We grasp the level. The five-sense reality can be manipulated. Just straight up. And so we're going to live in a world we're seeing is not the only thing. You're going to be trapped in this matrix that they've been building for decades. They've built this whole structure that they've placed over the natural world and they can bypass your senses with it. Literally. That's what it means to say a world where you can't tell the difference anymore between reality and what that is and this matrix. We're so realistic. You will not be able to tell the difference between that game and reality as we know it. And it's not a coincidence at all that all the movies and TV shows that you're seeing come out right now are just right there to reinforce this idea to you. That reality is not what you think it is. You aren't who you think you are. There's a hidden secret you haven't been told about everything. It's all coming together. There's a reason people refer to this as spiritual warfare. Take all this together out to its logic and conclusion. And it's like every episode of the Twilight Zone is now mixed together in a blender and unleashed on two society. It's beyond the matrix. The research is conducted by the US military's defense advanced research projects agency or DARPA, which we know too well by these robot videos. The new program is called Neural Engineering System Design or NESD, which aims to develop an implantable neural interface connecting humans directly to computers. Philip Elvall, the NESD manager for DARPA said its goal was to upgrade the tools that we have to really open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics. At the moment, human computer interfaces are able to connect between 100 and 1000 brain neurons to a machine at the time. DARPA aims to refine this technology to connect individual neurons. This would give much finer control, reduce noise and speed up communications between a human and a computer. DARPA's website confirms the news, also citing that among the program's potential applications are devices that could compensate for deficits inside or hearing by feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain at a resolution and experiential quality far higher than possible with current technology. Considering the DARPA's research has an end goal of military application, it's not hard to imagine where that could be used. So what exactly would the government do when they would control someone's mind? What could they make someone do when they manipulated their brains? Well, what it describes in the documents and in the published papers is there's actually photographs of this 16 year old girl, which has got a series of electrodes in her brain. Depending on which buttons being pushed on the transmitter, she's either strumming her guitar, pounding furiously on the wall or staring off into space. With the animals, they're actually directed to walk or swim to a target so you can control the actual physical motion and the mental state. How detailed and how fine-tuned that's gotten since 1970. Again, I don't know because it's all classified. It must have got a lot more developed. This technology can also be used to manipulate the emotions of the target. It can induce fear, love, hate. It can cause you to be nervous and cause you to be confident. It can cause you to be depressed. It can cause you to be happy. It can cause you to feel any fucking emotion at any time by artificially inducing them. This technology can be used to beam images and even motion pictures into one's brain. Images and motion pictures that are so realistic that you think you're actually watching a movie or seeing something in reality. It's like a virtual reality 3D rendering that takes place within the target's mind. Let's imagine that we could take our brain out of our body and keep it alive in a glass box. Then let's get a computer filled with information related to a particular setting such as image, sound, and smell. We'll connect this computer to the brain with electrodes and send the pre-recorded data to the brain. As our brain receives these signals, it will see and live the setting that the computer is transmitting. We could also send signals to the brain from this computer about our own image. For example, we could send the electrical information such as the sight, hearing, and touch. That we would experience while sitting at a desk. Our brain would perceive that we were a businessman sitting in his office. This imaginary world would continue as long as the information kept coming from the computer. And we would never realize that we were actually a brain sitting in a glass box. Our reality is increasingly being manipulated and mediated by technology to a point that is emerging, it's blending. And I think people are starting to feel it. The possibility of simulation is one day going to be inevitable. We're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality. It seems like people are like longing towards some weird log cabin-typeness reality. Yeah, like holding on, like clinging to sort of dragging the nails through the mud. Like don't take me yet. The World Wide Web only gives us the illusion of being present. But the reality is we're only in our homes connecting to a digital space. So that presence is an illusion. And once we get to a point of augmented and virtual reality world, that just takes the phrase spirit of slumber to a whole new unprecedented level. And so once you have connected the targeted individual with the frequency, and they resonate together, then you'll have a perfect avenue upon which to send and receive information back and forth. And that's exactly how they manipulate someone's thoughts. They send voices into someone's head. They manipulate their emotions. They manipulate their behavior. And then that's also how they receive back from the individual in real time. The vital signs, the emotions, the thoughts, what the person's seeing, what the person's hearing. And then all that information, of course, is rendered on a computer elsewhere. Via software, and it can be monitored and tracked in real time. It can literally stop your own thoughts from happening and replace them with other thoughts, by sending thoughts to your head. And it's so sophisticated that you cannot tell where these thoughts are coming from. There's no way to discern that they are coming from somewhere other than your own mind. So you can imagine how bad this would be for people that don't even realize this technology exists. And they're having these thoughts, which they think are spontaneous, because being under the influence of this technology now, kind of having been on both sides of it, I am just amazed at the way it works. And I know that the thoughts that they beam into your head, originate from the exact same place in your mind, that your own natural thoughts originate from. So if I didn't know I was under the influence of this technology, then I would have no idea that anyone was influencing my thoughts at all. And that's exactly what it can be used for. It can be used to sway people in terms of their opinion, to make them go along with the certain agenda. It can be used to turn groups of people or individuals against each other for whatever purpose. I'm a former naval officer. I'm a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. I have a degree in control systems engineering. I worked as a service warfare officer in electronics warfare and nuclear engineering jobs. While I was in the service, I found out there's an ongoing, non-concentral human experiment and it's testing a human machine interface weapon. Now, did you stumble upon this? Were you privy to it? Yeah, it was one of the issues where I think it was the next level up in the chain of command. If you, there's three or four jobs you could take, there was a couple of them where you might be right into this program. And so we've got this issue here where we have a non-concentral experiment with a group of, you know, American citizens. And these, you know, some former military, but a lot of just unsuspecting citizens. You know, it's a group of people here in the United States. They're calling themselves targeted individuals. And it's people from all walks of life. And a lot of it is people who can't fight back. You know, it seems like predominantly the folks we talk to on the calls are about 70 percent women, single women who live alone. You know, that may not have a technical background that could even imagine something like this. You know, happening in the past or could happen now. Now I understand how you can do something non-concentrally because it's not like you're going to the VA to get a prostate exam and then suddenly you're like, wow, something's going on. They're just picking you out using it. You don't know it. Yeah, completely wireless. So you have to infiltrate them with something though, right? Something that's a touch now. Not necessarily. I do know a lot of people think that it can be done completely remote. Wow. But the only people that are going to know for sure are the ones that work with this technology. This is something where you're going to get spends, you know, for the scientists portion. You're going to spend about six years, you know, developing your skills as a neuroscience. And that neuroscience is then as an operator that will work with a finished system. You're going to get at least 18 months to two years of... Which like... Marse... ...weapons are great until they turn it against you. Natural question, how concerned are you going on there and talking about this and walking across? Yeah. Why don't you just disappear and chill a coffee? No, no. I would just not. There's no way. These people are... This is like a torture one. I couldn't live with myself knowing that, you know, it's like... Not stepping in ahead of the Holocaust or not stepping in. You just made it up to like Capitol Hill or do any senators who say... Yeah, yeah, they're... Well, this group has done public outreach for something like 30 years. And then a couple of people came out of the government. One of them came out of the CI that worked with this equipment. He's got multiple degrees of Harvard and Dartmouth. He's talked on the radio just for quite a long time trying to let people know about this program. And it just doesn't go anywhere with the government. So it really needs to happen kind of grassroots, grassroots, organically. That people need to know that this is happening. But wouldn't there be people in the military or government angry about what you're doing? About spreading the word, not wanting people to know that this technology exists? Yeah, you can't worry about that. You're talking about, you know, they tortured people at the point where they're going and shooting up, you know, committing mass shootings. Those are not the people you need to worry about. That's not what the military is about. You know, there's a strong ethical undercurrent there. If they're giving an unlawful order, they know not to follow it. And it's clearly a case where this is a rogue program. So we have this up on our blog. On the Facebook. Where do people go, Dave, to find out if you've been tricked, then where do they go to get all the information? You can reach me at Facebook, David Voitz, also TI in America, cross-country walk. On both GoFundMe and the Facebook page. You have to remember that this CIA has a long history of experimenting on our citizens from right. LSD. Sure. Okay, we're talking here, like going back to MK Holdren, all that, the 60s and 70s. But we were told all that stopped. Is that untrue? Untrue. These programs continue under new names, new budgets. It's the ultimate weapon. Are there citizens of this country that are being abused with this technology? They're being worse than abuse. That's a light word. They're being tortured. Now, the brain is an amazing organ. When it functions, there are millions and millions of neurons that become active. And what we've done at DARPA is develop the technology in order to sense these signals in real time, or even write signals into the brain. You have sent those signals into a computer. That computer can interpret what all those signals actually mean when you're thinking about trying to do something. And we can place these sensors anywhere in your brain, or even in your peripheral nervous system. These are the nerves that are outside of your brain. Okay? So while you may have thought of neuro technology as I've just described, as being something way off in the future, it's actually a technology exists today. And we're actually using it with humans. So we started in animal subjects. We said, okay, let's try these sensors out. Can we read out the signals in real time? And can we do something simple like, control a robotic arm? And we showed that we could actually do that just having the animal think about it. And once we've proved out that technology, we said, okay, we're ready to go to humans. Can we place the same technology in the human brain and restore the ability to move or even sense after you've been injured? And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of this. Yes, we could do that. And we said, okay, again, this is DARPA. We tried to push the limits of what's possible. We said, okay, if we can do that for movement and sensation, can we try to do something even more complex? So we went to memory in the human and said, okay, for humans, could we restore their ability to form and recall memories? Again, direct brain interface. And the University of Oxford Functional Neurosurgery Group released a new report claiming that brain implants could be used to steal, spy on, alter or control human memories. A brain to machine interface is a system that allows a brain to directly communicate with a robot or computer. A necessary part of a brain to machine interface is an external EEG or, for a more advanced connection, a brain implant. The computer or robot controlled by a brain to machine interface can be very local, such as a computerized prosthetic arm or extremely distant. Experiments to date have included paralyzed individuals controlling robot arms and typing on computer screens with their thoughts, and even featured rat neurons piloting flight simulators. A communication does not need to be only in the direction of brain to machine. Information sent from machine to brain has already been used to create sensations of touch. In theory, brain to machine interfaces open up the possibility of avatar technology, not simply controlling an external limb or a computer screen, but controlling an entire artificial view, allowing you to be effectively in two places at the same time. But for long distance travel, be warned. It might be a bit disorienting as you experience an eight-minute delay between your thoughts on Earth and your avatar's movements on Mars. Would you want to explore Paris with a robotic avatar while your biological body mongered on the couch? Or take a nice hike while you mentally control your work computer? Watch where you're going, even if you are in two places at once. Your attention might not be a fear. This technology manipulates the electrical signals in the brain. Thus controlling thoughts and feelings and emotions and sensations throughout the body. It works by rewiring the brain by creating new neuropathways and destroying existing neuropathways. Thus, this literally changes the way a person thinks and thus behaves. This technology can also be used to control the muscle movement of the target. It can take over one's hands or feet while driving and make you press on the accelerator or press on the brake or turn. This can be used to cause accidents. It can also be used to prevent accidents from happening. This technology can also tap into the optical nerve of the target and the auditory system of the target so that those monitoring the target can see what the target is seeing and hear what the target is hearing. This information is then downloaded and stored on a computer in a highly secure classified site on servers that are guarded by some of the tightest security in the world. This results in the individual's entire day, everything they see, everything they hear, everything they experience and everything they feel being recorded till the end of time. The Katherine Haraj continues her reporting on a place where all that data is heading. Still Utah, 25 miles south of Salt Lake City, the NSA is nearing completion on a gargantuan new project. It's named the Utah Data Center. The NSA will neither confirm nor deny the specifics, but some estimate the center will be capable of storing five zetabytes of data or enough to store every email, cell phone call, Google search and surveillance camera video in America for a very long time. All the NSA would tell us is that the Utah Data Center is a facility for the intelligence community that will have a major focus on cyber security. We weren't given access last summer, but we could see it from the sky. I like to look right at the sky because right now we're 500 feet over the Utah Data Center and this is the closer you're going to get to out of security clearance. You can actually see the grades right now at your 12 o'clock. Wow, from the sky it's huge. Yes, it's a second. It's a really a turnkey situation where it can be turned quickly and become a totalitarian state pretty quickly. The capacity to do that is being set up. That's a chilling assessment from Bill Benny who worked at the NSA for nearly four decades starting as a data analyst in the days before desktop computers. After 9-11, the NSA began a warrantless surveillance program approved by President Bush. My estimate was that they were collecting on the order of three billion a day. That's just internal to this country. In simple terms, NSA was spying on Americans inside this country. That's great. Technology can also tap into the optical nerve of the target and the auditory system of the target so that those monitoring the target can see what the target is seeing and hear what the target is hearing. This information is then downloaded and stored on a computer in a highly secure classified site. A breaking news this evening is the identity of the man who sent the Obama administration into defend and explain mode this week. His name is Edward Snowden. He's an American former CIA employee in computer technician. Today he came out as the leaker of classified NSA documents that spell out a secret surveillance program. A student gave an on-chem interview to the Guardian newspaper and were playing it for you in its entirety. You're some more. Listen. When I think about an instance that really just struck me as, oh my god, we can do this. And that we can do it to anyone. And that we can do it to anyone. Was that people in NSA analysts can actually watch people's internet communications, watch them, draft course, or actually watch their thoughts form as they type. You write a message, you know, and analysts at NSA or any other service out there that's using this kind of attack against people. Any other service out there that's using this kind of attack against people can actually see you write sentences in the backspace over your mistakes and then change the words and kind of pause and think about what you wanted to say, pause and think about what you wanted to say. And then change it. And then change it. Change it. And it's this extraordinary intrusion. Not just into your communication, your finished messages, but your actual drafting process into the way you think. Into the way you think. Into the way you think. One thing I understand is that within the security of business, most of the people working there are ex-military and ex-intelligence operatives. And many of them, in fact, are still active intelligence operatives. And I've simply been reassigned to domestic duty to work with a private security company, specifically for the purposes of carrying out this highly illegal program that's being run against TIs all over America. So full-blown TIs, what I would call people that are getting the voice to skull, the frequency and the organized stocking. And I have heard is between one and two million and that could be completely on. But one of the things I'm concerned about is the technology is as being research and developing Seattle utilizes emotion manipulation and behavior manipulation without the game stalking and without the voice to skull aspects. And so this use of the technology can be done very covertly to the point where the person that's being used against will not know that this technology is being used against them. And that is one of my main concerns and one of the reasons why I want to bring more white to this technology and to this issue, because this technology could potentially be being used against tens to hundreds of millions of Americans every day. I mentioned some of my podcasts how there are field effects where they will not direct this technology and individual, but create a general field of frequency in a geographical area so that everybody within that geographical area is feeling the effects of the technology. And so I think that's more of a general application of the technology instead of an individual specific application of the technology. But when you consider that use of it and the fact that it is used for emotion and thought and behavior modification, then we could potentially be looking at many, many millions of people across the country under the influence of the technology today right now. Hundreds of people in the valley say they are hearing voices in their heads. Those voices are being transmitted by microwave or other methods. Well, several viewers asked us to investigate what they call electronic harassment. Hey, my six is Angela Monroe joined us now with what she's discovered, Angela. Electronic harassment is synthetic to let the voice to skull technology. Chances are you haven't heard of these terms, but after searching the internet, I found dozens of websites dedicated to phenomenon and several valley residents who say they're victims. How much more can you invade me than to go into my brain? It sounds like somebody else is reading the book only its thoughts. We're not having a group of hallucinations. This is actually something that's happening. These men all live in the area, didn't know each other before the voice is started and say someone is playing mind games with them. Mostly it's a lot of derogatory comments about whatever you're thinking about. Kevin Bond says he used to have a normal life. I was living in the San Diego area. I was looking for a federal judge and I noticed that I was being followed by a whole bunch of people. According to the websites, what Bond is describing is called gang stalking. He moved to Palm Springs to escape. I started hearing, as you'll hear the hearing voices and what they'll call voice to skull or microwave hearing. Bob Stansfield says his experience was similar and started a decade ago. They were active and following me around here and I started hearing the voices a little bit after they'd be a vehicular stalking. Randall Ringer says the voice is started when he was undergoing chemotherapy. The first thing that was said was Randall Ringer and I sat up straight and I went to the bathroom and I looked in the mirror. Looked myself in the eyes and I said did that really happen. Bond says he's found more than 300 victims locally and is tracking others across the state through billboards. Bond says neurotransmitter chips that run off body electricity have been inserted into some people. And they assign cell phone numbers to them. The cell phone numbers are then run through a computer and a computer translates your thoughts. This crime has been available to the military for 60 years. As many of the test subjects so-called, the people are being experimented on or as within the program as they're called a target. As many of them have already learned, one of the key means of covering up this program is to use the psychological profession to do so. Those who speak out about this issue are funneled to psychiatrists for evaluation. The psychiatrists are working with those who are running this program. In many cases they are directly paid by them to render a diagnosis of schizophrenic multiple personality disorder, delusional paranoid, depressed upon the test subjects, the targets, so that they will be discredited so that if they talk out any further or they ever start making any progress against this program, they are inherently discredited because those who run this program will simply release the program. They will simply release the psychological files and claim that the person is mentally ill. This is a perfect way to cover up such a technology whose main feature and most popular feature, most well known feature, is voice to skull, which induces sound within the cranial cavity of the test subject, of the target themselves, so that when that person goes to speak out about it, when they go to seek help from their fellow human beings, and their fellow human beings say, what is it that's happening to you? The target will then say, I'm hearing voices inside my head. It's the result of voices called technologies, the sophisticated microwave auditory effect. It's radio frequency signals that are being beamed at my fucking head that are causing me to hear sounds and voices inside my head. Obviously, if members of the general public are not aware of the existence of this technology, which many of them are not, most of them are not, then they will interpret that as concerning. They will feel concerned for the target and they will conclude that this person must be crazy and as a result they will recommend psychological evaluation for that person. You can see the way this is going to go and the way it is going right now. As good people, helpless people that are being abused and tortured and enslaved and experimented upon in America today, American citizens, cry out for help from their fellow Americans. And their fellow Americans say, why don't you take some prosack because we think your skits are frenic. When this is a highly technical program, all of the symptoms are induced by a technology that is so fucking sophisticated, it is horrifying beyond description. And you mentioned that you are convinced that this could still be going on today. What other kind of experiments do you think the CIA could be doing today? Well, I would say intelligence agencies around the world probably have mentoring candidate sleepers operative today. And they are using a whole range of techniques to control and create them, which is in interst organizations, there is going to be the religious doctrine part of it. But it is the basic mind control programming technology that we have known about for decades. You control the person's life space, control the information flow, talk to them, talk to them, talk to them, convince them, convince them, frighten them, terrorize them, soften them up with hypnosis, drugs, which can be IV drugs or drugs by mouth. So it is a whole range of different techniques, it is not just one thing. But here, not so long ago on a tragic night that has many wondering what could make a man snap and lose control. Kind of my last words. It is really unfortunate that I have to make this video. The CIA is a victim of covert harassment and electronic harassment and gang stalking. I am what is called a targeted individual. On November 20, 2014, 31-year-old Byron Mae walks into Strozier Library on the campus of Florida State University and opens fire. Three people are injured, Mae tries to leave campus and a shootout with police in front of the library ends violently. The medical examiner confirming Mae was shot 24 times by police. 6-03-1, we continue with a deadly school shooting and we are learning more about what confessed gunman Nicholas Cruz told investigators during an 11-hour interrogation. The transcript is more than 200 pages long. That was heavily redacted, we have learned that Cruz told the BSO detective that he heard a demon in his head. That police shooting down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as we said, three police officers were killed, three others were wounded when they were ambushed by a gunman who was dressed in all black. That suspect who was killed by other officers at the scene has now been identified as Gavin Long. He is a former Marine who is 29th birthday with Sunday the day of this attack. A lot of TIs, they don't even know that harassment is a felony. Stalking with harassment is a damn felony. That's a felony charge. You definitely have the right to defend yourself. If someone is and you know gang stalking is, they are trying to attempt you, they are trying to make you attempt suicide. That's a attempted murder. If someone is trying to attempt you to force you into suicide, isn't that a attempted murder? Come on now. Let's open our eyes and get it together. Hey, defend yourself at all costs. Stand in your righteousness. Die in your righteousness. Period. A shooting at the oldest Navy facility in the country, home to 15,000 including the Navy's top officer, and only a few miles from the White House and Capitol building. Panic in suit in Washington, DC today, as the death toll mounted. Back on. Multiple shots. Five. All four people down. We're still waiting for the okay, the same as the rest of years. The FBI released images of the weapon, a Remington 870 shotgun, which had messages etched on the side. Better off this way. And my ELF weapon. An apparent reference to extremely low frequency waves. Officials reckon he believed he was being controlled by them in the months before he killed 12 people. At this point, I can confirm that there are multiple indicators that Alexis held a delusional belief that he was being controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency or ELF electromagnetic waves. US and Cuban officials say they're investigating allegations of a possible acoustic attack on US embassy staff in Havana last year. Just to add to the confusion, there is speculation coming out of Washington that it may actually have been a third country that was involved in this. Now Russia is the leading suspect NBC News has learned according to three US officials and two others briefed on the investigation. Evidence they say backed up by highly secret communications intercepts collected during a lengthy and ongoing investigation involving the FBI CIA and other agencies. US officials also tell NBC News investigators now believe the Americans were deliberately targeted. Can I ask you a question about some of the technology that you're developing to fight the war on terror specifically directed energy and high power microwave technology. When do you envision that you can weaponize that type of technology? It is in for the most part the kinds of things you're talking about are in very early stages. Do you want to deal anything you'd add? I don't think I would add much. I think there are no stages and probably not ready for employment at this point. In the normal order of things when you invest in research and development and begin a developmental project, you don't have any intention or expectations that one would use it. On the other hand the real world intervenes from time to time and you reach in there and take something out that is still in a developmental stage and you might use it. So it's not your question is not answerable. It depends on what happens in the future and how well things move along the track and whether or not someone feels it's appropriate to reach into a development stage and see if something might be useful. What was the case with the unmanned aerial vehicles? You're going to experiment. I think that's the point. We have from beginning of this conflict. I think General Frank has been very open to looking at new things if there are new things available and has been willing to put them into the fight even before they've been fully wrung out. I think that's not referring to these particular cases of directed energy or high power to microwave. Who are the controllers? I mean is that our president? The Federal Reserve? No. So these are people within our government at a certain level making these decisions and they're not necessarily our president or our elected officials. That's exactly right. Wow. That makes it even more difficult because they can't be removed. They can't be removed and they're difficult to find. They hide in the dark crevices or whatever. You work for these people. You worked on this. You helped to develop it. I was naive. I did not know how the technologies were going to be put together and the ultimate weapon created. You're not still working for it. No. You're unequivocally looking at me right in the eye right now and you're telling me you have no more to do with this and that you're out to expose it. That's correct, sir. With your background and what you know, can you give us a hint on what we ought to do? No. No. Is it too late? I actually believe it's too late. So what you're telling me every one of us should be in fear of this because every one of us at some point will be targeted? The technologies advance that far. Every single man, woman and child in the United States of America will be under the influence of this technology. And as you can see going forward, what's going to happen is a dividing line is going to be drawn in America. And it's not going to be Democrat or Republican or Black and White, rich, poor, you know, due Gentile religious differences, whatever it is. It's going to be based on who is on the right and the wrong side of this technology who is on the right and the wrong side of this program. And so if you are not a part of this program, then there is a very real risk that you are going to become a full blown 24 or seven targeted individual. And this technology at that point when it is nationwide will be used by automated computer, super computer software programming that will manipulate the emotions and the behavior and the thoughts of everybody in the United States of America. And it can all be done remotely. And it's very much like the microchip kind of tracking the new world order, this entire, you know, control grid that's supposed to be rolled out against the American people someday. And I'm here to tell you that it's already here. There isn't going to come a day where there's troops in the streets and tanks rolling down your neighborhood and riot gear and all this stuff. We might have isolated incidents like that. It might get that like that every once in a while, but the true control grid is this technology, voice to skull, hive mind, behavior manipulation technology. And it can all be done remotely. It can be done simply by targeting you with the frequency, locking into the resident frequency of your DNA and your mind. And in that manner, completely track and trace and control you 24 hours a day. Okay, doctor, to deliver this, how do they get into your head? I've heard of these Gwen towers. They allegedly were used before and now they claim that they're not used for anything. They do match up with the properties and necessary capabilities. They easily could be broadcasting across the country, messages to people and causing them extreme pain. That's part of the whole world domination strategy. Control the population from subconsciously to consciously. And now we've got a motive. Controlling the centers. Controlling the world. Controlling me and me. The Internet of Things and the Fodgy Greta's the end game of the New World Order and it is the New World Order itself. The New World Order being the New World where everything is orderly. Everything is tracked. Everything is accounted for. Remove every action. Every conversation. Every thought. Everything people do is tracked. What you're looking at the Internet of Things and this 5G surveillance grid and what is really coming online. This technology that is coming online. Everything else kind of pales into insignificance because in this AI grid that is coming online to control us and it will be an AI grid. It will be controlled by AI. This is in their own plans. In this grid there is no one you can really point the finger at. There is no government you can bring down. There is no one you can really say is the controlling hand at that point. All control leaves the hands of the people and control gets handed over to the Internet itself. And that's what they're working towards and it's in all their own documents. We're now at a stage where we're putting in what's called 5G which is a special type of broadcast for high density information transfer. And it turns out that this is the same frequency bands that are used in the Crowd dispersal weaponry. 5G first and foremost is densification. So it's significantly more transmitted as a close proximity to the human. And it is also a sophisticated and legal unlawful transmitter. What I mean by that is it is a high gain, dialect that lands antenna and what that allows 5G transmitters to do is to treating map its environment in your home. The age 68 megahertz frequency is specific for all seal interrogation systems. So so gigahertz allows the signal to travel through concrete brick work where he's armed. It can actually get a gunner. It is a target the choir in system. The frequency that's being emitted by the device will have an effect on a geographical location. Let's say downtown Seattle. And so what they can do is within this general field they can broadcast a frequency that affects human beings within that frequency field and can induce a general mood of let's say happiness or sadness, anger, agitation, peacefulness. And in this way they can have an overall effect in the city. And I have seen this done it is remarkable how effective it is because you will walk down the street of Seattle and literally see people all in a bad mood all at the same time and they do not know each other and then you go over a block or two to a different office building and you walk in and the exact same things going on there. It's very concerning. So within that then that overall bubble or area of frequency where everybody let's say is in a bad mood they can still inject what would be a individual specific frequency to the targeted individual themselves. The homeless person in Seattle that's being experimented on 24 hours a day so they will be under the influence of the general agitated mood or bad mood that everybody else is in and then they can more further be manipulated by the frequency that's being directed solely at them. Shares to rear is basically radar of the battlefield. It is extremely good and identifying targets and being locked on the targets. And not only that it can specifically target you as an individual. So any judge sitting on an in western case let's say any lawyer, any barrister, anybody doing any work that is potentially controversial your life could be upset. So the antenna design that it currently has non-stop of these LED street lights mask room in as a control management system it basically barceled into interrogation equipment. The first phase to rear unit was actually called mammoth used by the Germans during the Second World War II identify Allied aircraft obviously things have moved on significantly since then. The radio frequencies microwave signals the entire spectrum of radio frequencies can be used within a certain range to produce all sorts of different effects. So the what the way it works is a device broadcast a radio frequency let's say at an individual and that radio frequency will hook up with the resident frequency of the individuals mind or body or in this case DNA. And what happens is once the resident frequency is found in the target individual and the broadcast frequency matches up with that resident frequency those two frequencies interlock and they can be thought of as one frequency or one energy. And what happens is between the broadcast frequency and the individual that's receiving the broadcast frequency once it's resonating once they are resonating together a super highway of frequency along which information can be sent is created. And so you can think of it just like fiber optic cables that you use to send signals over the internet that connects people to the internet it's the exact same thing only a wireless application of that. Rosade was working with the CIA and exchanging technology and study data with Russians of back in the 60s and 70s and even further back and he figured out scientifically demonstratably how non ionizing radiation and various specific frequencies from microwaves or for mother signals how they could alter human and animal behavior. For instance, a simple ten hurts wave could put someone into a stupor within a couple of minutes using neuro electric devices that they developed by the 70s they could put individuals or entire towns to sleep on command they can aggravate people they can alter their sexual preferences they can delete their memories they can turn on desire they can turn on repulsion and they can otherwise hijack someone spontaneous and natural behavior they can literally hijack your nervous system. And that was 30 or 40 years ago now things are very advanced they're very precise and they're very far along there's discussions now at the Davos world economic forum that have broached the topic of mind reading and literal mind control. And these devices the capability to do it is built into everything every handheld unit every laptop mobile device that everyone's carrying around and once things are fast enough with 5G all bets are off the constant ubiquitous connection with these next generation 5G towers. But what else could you say I don't want to add paranoia I don't want to make people fearful but basically where can you run from this once the system is fully launched and up it's it's going to be just like the terminator genesis system it's going to be the rise of AI and it's going to be like there's no looking back. Touch all corners of our country we're the pioneers of a new spec. Frontier no one gave permission for this because most people don't fully understand what's happening or why it matters they're going to click on little agreements on their cell phone for the different sites they visit and they're going to have no idea how much is going to be taken from that. But it's clear that this is not a good bargain and people need to be warned they should try to oppose this in their local cities and where they can and try to challenge these companies because they don't want a face resistance and they don't want a population that knows about the dangers and the risks of this technology. In 1953 the Russians began to bombard the US Embassy in Moscow with electric magnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum but the fact was kept secret from the embassy employees. Dr. Henry Kissinger sent a secret memo giving hazard paid embassy personnel in the 1970s. Before the attacks the USSR had met with the US to try to head off an arms race in the electromagnetic weapons but were refused. In retaliation they began microwaving the US Embassy. It is possible that the US government took advantage of the situation and used the embassy staff as microwave guinea pigs. The Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA, set up a lab at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and participated in Project Pandora. Scientists began zapping monkeys to study the biological effects of highly concentrated microwave frequencies. Similar studies were conducted at the VA Hospital in Kansas City, University of Rochester, Brooks Air Force Base, Johns Hopkins, MIT, the MIT Corporation, University of Pennsylvania, and other domestic and foreign labs. Something else the 5G grid can do is it can see through walls, it can see through houses, it can see what you're carrying along the street, it can see if you're carrying money, it may be able to tell if you're carrying a weapon. If you are carrying a weapon it can disable you with a millimeter wave or it can even perhaps send a signal to a drone and have you targeted from the air. All of this is capable through the 5G system, it's also possible to take control of vehicles with computers in them, it's an all-encompassing system. And this is not just being used for communication, this is being used for surveillance and control. San Diego could become the smartest city in the US. San Diego is partnering with General Electric to upgrade the city's streetlights into a digital network that can optimize traffic and enhance public safety. More than 3000 streetlights in San Diego will be equipped with real-time anonymous sensors, cameras, and microphones. The streetlights will be connected to form an IoT network. The streetlights can measure air quality, locate vacant parking spaces, monitor traffic flow of vehicles and pedestrians, as well as detect gun violence. The city will also replace 14,000 streetlights with technology that allows them to dim or brighten manually or automatically according to natural light conditions. The installation will begin this summer with a potential for 3000 more sensors to be added in the future. This is not just an incremental change, this is a big step up. It's a sea change, and on slot is not in proper word, it's a bombardment. So instead of a cell power, one mile or two miles from you and you still have cell phone service, we're going to have antennas every block, and some porcelain is going to have one-mountitude utility pole, maybe less than 20 meters from their home. So this kind of invasive bombardment with this many antennas, I mean just in one square mile, if you do the math, one per block, and 16 blocks per mile, that's about 250 antennas per square mile. The millimeter wave is untested, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler openly said that they don't plan to test. We won't wait for the standards. So also addresses the fact that there's a plan to roll out 5G through satellites in lower orbit. So 20,000 satellites which will cover every square foot of the planet with a 5G signal. So this amazing set of missions I aim to create a super low latency telecommunications network and how are they going to do this? Not by launching just these 60 satellites, which let's face it isn't damn amazing mission by itself, but by launching around 12,000 satellites, in three sophisticated orbital shells around the world. No big deal, right? The better question might be why a SpaceX attempting to create this network. What this whole system is leading towards folks is complete digital control of everybody and emerging of human beings with AI. And when you look at Elon Musk and some of the stuff he's been putting out, he's saying that it is necessary for us to merge with AI. It's going to be the only way to save us against AI completely taking over. And he's saying this needs to be done through a neural net and it will send to this. If you assume any rate of advancement in AI, we will be left behind by a lot. That is Elon Musk, the inventor and entrepreneur behind such futuristic endeavors as Tesla, SpaceX, and Hyperloop. And as you heard, Elon Musk has AI, artificial intelligence on his mind these days. He says AI machines could soon outsmart us all. And his philosophy is if we can't beat him, we should join him by implanting AI computers directly into our brains. So from a long term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of neural link is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbolic with AI. Because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through your fingers as too slow. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving that the neural link between your cortex and the digital extension of self, which already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. Pay close attention to what he said there. What he said was that this interface already exists. It's just that they have to improve the bandwidth. They have bandwidth problems. So how might these bandwidth problems be improved? It's not just that 5G is faster than 4G and that's it. It has other features such as much lower latency. It also has higher capacity for bandwidth and higher capacity for number of devices. SpaceX took the first step towards its orbiting internet system late Thursday. A Falcon 9 rocket launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral with a payload of 60 small satellites. Eventually CEO Elon Musk wants to put 12,000 up there. As these smart technologies begin to invade our homes, we are becoming near nodes in a giant network that we yet but dimly comprehend. Called the Internet of Things, the plan is to create a network that will eventually include every single object on the planet. And as the public is finally becoming aware, such networks provide golden opportunities for corporations and governments alike to collect data and spy on the population. This is not mere conjecture. Before becoming a meshed in an affair that ultimately derailed his career, former CIA director David Petraeus bragged openly about how these smart technologies would allow intelligence agencies to spy on everyone in their own homes using their own appliances. Speaking at a summit for InQTell, the CIA's venture capital firm Petraeus noted, items of interest will be located, identified, monitored, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters. In practice, these technologies could lead to rapid integration of data from close societies and provide near continuous, persistent monitoring of virtually anywhere we choose. Whether Petraeus' own downfall is a result of FBI use-dropping on private emails as part of a plan to warn future would be whistleblowers, poetic justice, or mere irony, it is nonetheless instructive. When everything that anyone does is tracked, traced, and databaseed at all times from our dishwasher usage to our television viewing to our toilet flushes, no one will be able to avoid the gaze of the state regardless of whether or not they have something to hide. As IT world's Kevin Fogarty observed, if J. Edgar Hoover were alive, he would die of jealousy at the technologies available to the would-be-big brothers of today. For the unimaginative out there, Hollywood yarns like enemy of the state have provided fictional examples of what can go wrong if someone, somewhere, abuses the power of information and surveillance to target an innocent person in the wrong place at the wrong time. To be sure, the power that these technologies give for agencies or corrupt groups within those agencies to destroy the lines of targeted individuals is itself a fitting answer to the question of why government surveillance should be troubling to us. But beyond what can happen to specific targeted individuals in such a scenario is a much larger question. What if this data were being fed into a database so gargantuan it contains a digital version of every single person on the planet? And what if that database were being used by the Department of Defense to war game various scenarios, from public reactions to natural disasters, to the likelihood of civil unrest and the wake of a declaration of martial law? Remarkably, this is precisely what is happening. It is called the sentient world simulation. The program's aim, according to its creator, is to be a continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the real world that could be used to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action. In practical terms, that equates to a computer simulation of the entire planet, complete with billions of nodes, representing every person on the Earth. At the time of initial reports on the program five years ago, there were only 62 country level simulations being run by the US Department of Defense. These simulations grouped humans into composites, with 100 individuals acting as a single node. But already at that time, the US Army had used the systems to create a one-to-one level simulation of potential army recruits. The ultimate aim would be to archive enough data on each individual to be able to make a computer model of everyone on the planet, one that could be used to predict the behaviors and reactions of every single person in the event of various scenarios. The original concept paper for the project was published in 2006, and in 2007 it was reported that both Homeland Security and the Defense Department were already using the system to simulate the American public's reaction to various crises. In intervening five years, however, there has been almost no coverage at all of the sentient world simulation, where its progress in achieving a model of the Earth. Now creating a world simulation is not a new concept, even a sentient one has been attempted over and over. For the public, these often came in the form of video games. The problem with these models is that they have to be constantly changed and upgraded, every time there is a major event, new trend, or change in the real world. The sentient world simulation does this automatically. So what this is is a synthetic mirror of the world we live in, not a piece of it, but the entire world. And this program constantly recalibrates the simulation based on real-time world events, trends, theories, economics, and industry, almost everything you can think of that would contribute to an accurate model, not to mention the individual pieces of data on every single person represented in the simulation. So to put this in perspective, what this is is a digital clone of our world and everyone in it. A former NSA official claims that the United States is now our hair's breadth from becoming a turnkey totalitarian state. Intelligence communities or agencies of the world are gaining too much influence over government, how governments operate. And this is moving really to a stazzy state, basically, and it's not just the United States, it's countries all around the world. You have to be aware that these agencies are threatening what is fundamental to human rights everywhere. And you've got to ensure that you have some way of verifying and keeping these agencies in line. Though the official mandate of the NSA is to eavesdrop on foreign communications, we now know that it has long been pointing its instruments in red. In the Philippines, circa 1950, CIA's I was operative at Lanzdale, employed a technique known as the Eye of God. At night, operatives would paint an eye on the wall of a house facing a suspected communist or communist sympathizer. The message we are watching you. In some respects, the NSA's well-publicized spy on American citizens has the same effect. The very fact that they have claimed the right to spy on American citizens is a gross violation of their mandate. Similarly, the CIA, which is prohibited from conducting internal security functions within the United States, has repeatedly broken its own rules. Under Operation Chaos, the agency spied on leftist during the civil rights era. Under MK-Eltra, they used thousands of American citizens as human guinea pigs. During Operation Mockingbird, they illegally propagandized the American public. According to CIA documents for 25 years, more than 400 American journalists secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency. Some people did this in exchange for money while others did this voluntarily. Among the participants were Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and even famous correspondents. Assignments included intelligence gathering, publishing agency press releases as stories, shaping other stories, and even planting false information. Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to a major circulation American Journal? We do have people who submit pieces to other two American Journalists. Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks? This I think gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into an executive session. The Just as Eisenhower would later warn of a military industrial complex that he himself had helped to create Truman with voice alarm over the evolution of the Central Intelligence Agency. He came to not only regret it, but to speak out about it in 1963, 30 days to the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Truman actually wrote an op-ed that was published in the Washington Post in which he revealed this and he said, I never intended it for it to become what it has become. And this is very interesting because that op-ed appeared in the early edition of the Washington Post and then it was ex-sized from all the later editions that day. Alan Dulles, perhaps the most important of the CIA directors, flew out to Independence, Missouri to try to get Truman to retract what he had written and he refused. November 22, 1963, not only did John Kennedy die, is also the day America's free press die. They became proven aiders, a betters and protectors of the known murderers of President John F. Kennedy. At the same time the OPC became operational. The National Security Council approved a radical new policy. It secretly authorized the CIA to conduct programs which were officially non-existent, thereby bypassing the U.S. Congress. The NSC ordered that the new operations be deniable, meaning planned and executed so that any U.S. government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorize persons. And that for those uncovered, the U.S. government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility. And that is really the genesis of unacknowledged special access projects. Now a special access project just means you have to have the clearance to get to it and be read into it as they say in military speak. But an unacknowledged project, I just want to go through a minute how that works. Let's say that this gentleman is a four-star general and I'm a colonel. I made a Joe four-star general. But I'm in an unacknowledged special access project dealing with this or some other subject to can be other things as well. If I am in an unacknowledged project, I am told and I have one of my most senior military advisors has been in multiple of these. He was in one project that was two to three billion dollars. He knew it was more than two and almost three billion in a project that was off the books. No accounting, president didn't know, Congress didn't know, tightly held, a military guy working with some corporate folks. And he told me, he says here's how it works. He says they take you to a skiff, a secure communication intelligence facility, SCIF. Take all the equipment off of you. Any guns, off cell phones, watches, nothing. Anything metallic. You go in to this underground facility and there's a meeting. And he said, you have a come into Jesus' talk. And what happens is that you are told that only the people in that room are read into and cleared to this unacknowledged special access project. And if you speak a bit outside of that circle of people, there's one person there with a gun and a bullet. He takes the bullet out. He says, it has your name on it. If you speak to anyone, I mean anyone, your wife, the president, your commander about what we're doing. And that is how it works. This is not a conspiracy theory. I've been in these skiffs. I've been in a couple places and I can tell you that is exactly how it operates. The real tragedy of it though is that if you have a breakdown in government this severe, those of you who are students of governance, where you can have a CIA director or senior members of the military who are being left out of something very important and which hundreds of billions of dollars per year are going into, then you have no government. So the deep national security state from 1950s until today has devolved into this sub-roso unacknowledged, not international, transnational entity with representation in the UK, Canada, Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, former Soviet Union, which on this issue worked together like this. It is not responsive to the body politic. It is not responsive to the heads of government or even the heads of committees and cabinet level people. There are some cabinet level people, however, who have known. I mentioned a few. There was a CIA director known as George H.W. Bush. But then there are others like Wolsey, who wouldn't be told anything. Some presidents have been given a little information and some have been told nothing. The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society. And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, but to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know. But we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, underrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tight-knit highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published, its mistakes are buried, not headlined, its dissent is a silenced, not praised. Its dissent is a silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. What you know is still a wind has grown, SSO, the expanded special source operations that took over still a wind share of the pie, is spread all over the world to practically include comprehensive coverage of the United States. Disturbingly, the amount of US communication ingested by NSA is still increasing. Publicly, we can play in things are going dark, but in fact, our accesses are improving. The truth is that the NSA has never in its history collected more than it does now. I know the location of most domestic interception points, and that the largest telecommunication companies in the US are between the trust of their customers, which I can prove. We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of men. We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of men. We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of men. We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of men. I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers, I welcome. This administration intends to be candid about its errors, whereas a wise man once said, an error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors, and we expect you to point them out when we miss them. Without debate, without criticism, no administration and no country can succeed, and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian lawmaker solar, decreed a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. And that is why our press was protected by the first amendment, the only business in America, specifically protected by the Constitution, not primarily to have used and entertained. Not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply give the public what it wants, but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate, and sometimes even anger, public opinion. This means greater coverage and analysis of international news, or it is no longer far away, and far and a close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news, as well as improved transmission. It means finally that government at all levels must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security. So it is to the printing press, to the recorder of man's deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news, that we look for strength and assistance. Confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be, free and independent.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_282.mp3:  Alrighty, we are going to learn how to put a MailChimp subscription signup form on your Wordpress blog. They have a widget that you can add to your blog. They have a plugin that you can use to create this widget and we're going to show you what to do. So first of all, you need to create an account with MailChimp, which is an autoresponder service and you can do that and you can set one up for free to start with. And that's what we've done here. So I've created a list called Matt's List. Once you log in, you go up here and you click Create a List. Okay, create a list again. The first thing you need to do and you name the list, you put the email that the list is that you're going to be sending email addresses from. That's going to be the from email address that people will see when they receive your newsletters. So if they respond to it, they will respond to your email address. So decide what that email address is. Case people have questions. They might want to respond. It's good to have a working email that you look at for that. There's a little reminder for people to remind them that hey, they really did subscribe to you newsletter from your website. So you put a little reminder there about that. Put your address. Put a physical address that's part of the Can spam act, which is required when you send out bulk emails to people. And then you can get notifications daily summary one by one when people subscribe. That can be kind of fun at first, but after a while, it gets old. If you're getting a lot of subscribers, sometimes it's just fine to get a daily summary. Then you click Save and you've created your list. We have already done that here. And I have Matt's list. So now what I want to do is I want to let people give people opportunity to subscribe from my list to my list on my WordPress blog. I want to put a little subscription form on there. Okay, I'll show you what I mean. Okay, here's my one of my blogs that are just the process of setting up. And this is what a subscription form looks like using the Mailchip plugin on your WordPress blog. I have a WordPress blog and I very quickly created a simple form. And this is what we're going to do. So people when they come to my blog or to your blog, they can come here and decide to receive newsletter updates from you. And this is how they subscribe directly from your website. So this is the form that we're going to put on. I just like to show you what it looked like. All right, we're now we're back here in the Mailchimp login. You've created a list. Gone through that. Now we click on this little arrow and we're going to go to sign up forms. Now, there's a number of ways, different ways to do it. But for these purposes, we are going to use their WordPress plugin. Okay, and they talk about that down here. Learn more. All right, we're going to use the WordPress list subscribe form for WordPress. So the first thing you need to do is to log into the back office of your WordPress blog. So I'm here at the dashboard and we're going to add a plugin to the WordPress blog, a special plugin that allows you to add a subscription form. So you come here to plugins, okay, and then we're going to come to add new plugins add new. So here we are in the plugin section of your WordPress dashboard in the add, we're in the add plugin section. So we're going to go to search plugins and we're going to search for the exact name of the plugin. So the exact name of the plugin is Mailchimp WordPress list subscribe form. So in the search box, you put Mailchimp WordPress list subscribe form. Okay, and now we're going to do is we're going to click search. And what all I did, actually, I didn't click search, I just clicked enter on my keyboard. And here I have found Mailchimp list subscribe form. So I copied and pasted or typed in Mailchimp WordPress list subscribe form in the add plugins area. And I click the enter key on my keyboard. That's the same thing as search. And I get this plugin Mailchimp list subscribe form. So I'm going to install this plugin into WordPress. Yes, I'm sure I want to install the plugin. Now for on my setup, I have to put the FTP login information for my website. It may be different for your setup, but here I have to put in my login information. That's what I'm going to do. This is my FTP login information. Okay, now I've successfully installed it. Now I need to activate it. There we go. I have activated the Mailchimp form plugin. And now you will see it is here listed in plugins has active. Now I click on settings. And here you just put some basic information. Here I have my website that I'm just beginning to build is about software. So join our list to get free marketing software. You know, I put free marketing software. You can get more creative than this. I even misspelled this. I did it very quickly. You can get creative. You know, the good idea is to give people an incentive to join your list. Join our list and get free tips about whatever your subject is. Get a free course. Get our latest updates. The idea of this is to keep in touch with people who are interested in what you're writing about on your blog. And you could fool around with this. But that's basically what this is. So I'm going to update, subscribe for them settings. Now, as all these other settings here, you can play with. Can I am not going to go in through all of them. This one's kind of important is what fields do you want to require? Of course, have to require an email address. That's the whole point of this. And it's up to you whether you want to require a last name. Just a note, the more fields you ask people to fill in, the less subscribers you will get. I generally go with first thing email address because it is nice to personalize the emails. And you could put a little tag that says first name and their first name will appear. It's a little more personal and you do get better open rates when emails are personalized. Other people just go for email address only. You will get more subscribers, but you will not be able to personalize the email. I do not go for last name. I think that's enough. First name email address. That's just me. Now we want to go back to the dashboard of our WordPress setup and go to a page. And we go to appearance and we're going to go to widgets. We click on widgets. Now this may vary according to the theme you're using on your WordPress blog. I'm just using 2011. It's a very basic theme. Here is the WordPress widget. So all you have to do is drag and drop this widget where you want the sign up form to appear. Say if I want it to appear up here on my sidebar, I put it here. Save. Close. Now let's look at my blog. Wow, there's my sign up form. Now when people fill in their email address and name and click get free software, you could say anything you want. You want to get free tips. And so on and so forth. That's up to you to be creative. You control what's up here. You control what's up here. Try to give them an incentive to join the list. Here's my real subscription form that I'm using. I'm using a little different strategy. I put here. A bullet point gets $6,000 of free software. I get a rebrandable ebook. Get reviews of the latest marketing software. You know, I'm going towards my audience. But you'll figure out what's good for your audience. But the bottom line is you have now a subscription form on your website, on your blog. And now people can subscribe to your newsletter. And basically you just add it up. Plug in. Then that plug in added a widget and you dragged and dropped the widget over to where you wanted the form to show up. So that's basically it. You can play with it. And let me know if you have any questions. It could vary a little bit according to your setup. But it's relatively simple. It's been a little time on it. And you can have a nice form on your blog. And people can follow up. You could follow up with visitors on your newsletter. And as far as I'm concerned, it's the number one marketing method there is. Having an email list. It's done very well for me. Okay. Thanks a lot.\n",

They are the first all black women's team to win the cross examination debate associations national championship. This morning we have two of the team members here. We have Amina Ruffin and Corey Johnson both here to talk about the major victory. Ladies, way to go. Congratulations. Thank you so much. You've made so many people proud in this area. Now we want to pick your brain a little bit as we admire your huge trophy by the way. That's ridiculous. But I'm going to ask you first. We'll start with you Amina. What was the topic first of all? The topic was in the stripping presidential war powers authority. They said the niggas always already queered. That's exactly the point. It means that the impact is an impact turn to the affirmative. It is the case turn to the affirmative because we are saying that queer bodies are not able to survive. They're necessarily means that the body of the niggas is not able to survive. We got the topic in about July. And we started doing our research then. Now the niggas see these things suffering. They can only envision him suffering. Does not see another niggas that he can feel 74 or embrace for rather that other niggas get obliterated. We've been supplementing our research throughout the season. A mental opportunity after this niggas religion trauma, a numbs stuff against the trauma representation of actions into the life childhood. The body of the niggas is twisted into the white culture, a disease to think and add subjective to the white green, the black man. So where do you go from there? When you start preparing for a national competition, once you know the topic, what's next? Well, you do a lot of research. It says that the way that the status quo works is through a whiteness allowing a forcing other body to tell a narration of whiteness to the violence is the whiteness of the child. Say that is the link that we will go for. In order to prepare for it, we consider several of the circumstances until we need your attention and position and we need you to turn around. We've got some examples of the told you to cultural representation in the white world of the cultural. We'll move the white world to the child eyes on him. We'll to respond to opponents argument. On such a true trauma as a way of browning is racist cultural fantasy, the cultural traffic and images of the black men's homogeneic objects. So just a lot of preparation. We just make a lynching trauma and a numbs stuff inside the trauma representation and the black child with the bowing. We're not allowed to read. Reading of articles and books. Did they all leave? We created what it means to be an authentic nigga because we are not allowed to read. We are not allowed to read certain things or speak in a certain way because we are a person that's not just naturally speaking. Truly speaking to a nigga is a question of who even wrote this shit. Oh, that's good. No. Was there anything that's where you are during the competition? You know, something that someone else said, another team that made you go? It'd be crazy that today's articles would see a number of them.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_12.mp3:  I didn't to March, I realized that locking down wasn't necessary. In fact, I was so naive at the time, I had no idea. I thought I would call a few people, had some connections with the medical community, pretty extensive actually, in my state, and I thought I could call around and let people know, like, hey, we've got a strategy here. It's not bad. We can prophylax, and we could use hydroxychloroquine as a first-line therapy. We don't need to lock down. We can protect our elderly with prophylaxis, really low doses. And I actually thought that that was actually going to be well received. Instead, I was told to go home and to go home and don't use the personal protective equipment because I was just wasting resources. And I literally was on the phone. I won't say who it was, but it fairly well. I'll hire a person in our society in Texas. I'm one of the boards. And I told him, I said, how old are you? He said, I'm 40, something. I said, look, I've been through the AIDS epidemic. We didn't know if we touched the patients what was going to happen. And I go, I've been through another, that pandemic itself was very eye-opening for me. I was very scared. I was a young doc. And I didn't go home. I went to work. I went to work. I'm going to see patients. I told them right then, I said, look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings. But as far as I'm concerned, you're a coward. You go home. You go home. I said, I'm not going home. I'm going to work. I go, I did six years in the ER, 100, 200 hours a month. I've been on a bunch of trauma teams. I'm not going home. I'm going to see patients. So that turned into a short visit with some of my friends, some of their, some of my patients who would call me, knowing that I had talked to them about this disease. And I ended up treating the disease. And then I got on a Facebook live video that, in about two hours, reached 100,000 people. And I saw it. I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to get some repercussions. Sure enough, I did. The board came calling. And they said, you said that hydroxyloric and works. And you're basically a public menace. And we want to know who you treated. You said you, at the time, it was really early on. I said, treat it three patients. And I had to provide all the records, all the information. I was very intimidated, as you might imagine, because I have to practice. I have to feed my family. I love what I'm doing, but I'm not independently wealthy. I was a little bit afraid. It really was. That lasted about a day. At that point, again, as Dr. Gold said, we've got to do the right thing for the patients. At the time, I wrote a bunch of letters saying, I'm not going to let my patients get on vents and neckmoats. Not going to happen. I'm not going to allow it to happen. I'm going to treat them. I don't care. Well, suffice it to say, I got reprimanded. I'm still in a process of negotiation with that whole thing. But as Dr. Armstrong said, I'm really not afraid. I know I'm doing the right thing. I've treated a number of patients. I won't sell you how many, because then I'll probably have to provide records for all that. So for the purposes of this statement, I'm going to say I treated three. OK. So the fear of reprisal is the reason why we're in this place right now. Docs don't want to do this. There's a fear of reprisal. I was very worried about it. And I can tell you all the people who believe in this medication, who believe in early treatment, feel the same way. They're really scared to go forward and treat patients, because they don't want to lose their medical license. And that's a big deal. So the intimidation is a big deal. Mr. Jordan. I think Mr. Chairman, Dr. Fauci, do protest increase the spread of the virus? Do protest increase the spread of the virus? I think I can make a general statement. Oh, half a million protesters on June 6th alone. I'm just asking that number of people. Does it increase the spread of the virus? Crouting together, particularly when you're not wearing a mask contributes to the spread of the virus. Should we limit the protesting? I'm not sure what you mean. How do we say limit the protesting? Do the government limit the protesting? I don't think that's relevant to. Well, you just said that if it increases the spread of the virus, I'm just asking should we limit it? Well, I'm not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way. Well, you make all kinds of recommendations. You make comments on dating, on baseball, and everything you can imagine. I'm just asking you, you just said that the protest increase the spread I'm just asking should we try to limit the protest? I think I would leave that to people who have more of a position to do that. I can tell you. Government stopped them people from going to church, Dr. Fauci. Last week in the Calvary Chapel case, five liberals on the Supreme Court said it was OK for Nevada to limit church services. Governor, I mean, Justice Gorset said the best. He said there's no world in which the Constitution permission to vat it a favor. Caesars Palace over Calvary Chapel. I'm just asking, is there a world where the Constitution says you can favor one first amendment liberty protesting over another practicing your faith? I'm not favoring anybody over anybody. I'm just making a statement that's a broad statement that avoid crowds of any type no matter where you are, because that leads to the acquisition and transmission. And I don't judge one crowd versus another crowd. When you're in a crowd, particularly if you're not wearing a mask, that induces the same. It's a simple question, Dr., should we limit the protest? Government is obviously limiting people on the chair. And look, there's been no violence. I can see a church. I haven't seen people during a church service go out and harm police officers or burn buildings. But we know that, I mean, for 63 days, nine weeks it's been happening in Portland. Well, one night in Chicago, 49 officers were injured. But no limit to protest. But boy, you can't go to church on Sunday. I don't know how many times I can answer that. I'm not going to opine on limiting anything. I'm just going to tell you. You'll opine on a lot of things, Dr. Fauci. Yeah, but I've never said something that directly impacts the spread of the virus. And I'm asking your position on the protest. Yeah. Well, I'm not going to opine on limiting anything. I'm telling you what it is, the danger. And you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds no matter where the crowd is. Government is stopped people from going to work. In fact, just in New Jersey four days ago, Ian Smith, Frank Trumbetta, were arrested for opening up, trying to operate their business there, Jim. They were arrested. But my bet is, if these two individuals own this gym, we're outside just in front of their gym. And all the people who are working out in their gym were outside protesting. They've been just fine. But because they were in the gym working out, actually running their business, they got arrested. You think that's OK? You know, I'm not going to opine on who gets arrested and who does not. I mean, you get where I'm going. I'm telling you, as a public health official, I say, crowds. Do you see the inconsistency, though, Dr. Fauci? There's no inconsistency, Congressman. What? So you're allowed to protest millions of people on one day in crowds yelling, screaming, but you try to run your business, you get arrested. And if you stood right outside of that same business and protested, you wouldn't get arrested. You don't see any inconsistency there? I don't understand what you're asking me is a public health official to appoint on who should get arrested or not. That's not my position. You could ask me to advocate for my position. You've advocated for my position. I'm not an advocate. For certain businesses to be shut down. I'm just asking you on your position on the protest. I mean, I haven't seen one. We've heard a lot about hair salons. I haven't seen one hairstylist who between haircuts goes out and attacks police or sets something on fire. But we've seen all kinds of that stuff during protest. And we know the protest actually increased the spread of the virus. You've said that. I said crowds. I didn't say specifically. I didn't say protest to any. So the protest don't increase the spread of the virus. I didn't say that. You're putting words in my mouth. No, I would, I would, I just want an answer to the question. Do the protest increase the spread of the virus? I don't have any scientific evidence that anything I can tell you that crowds are known, particularly when you don't have a mask to increase the acquisition and transmission. No matter what the crowd is. So you don't have a position on whether the protest increased the spread of the virus or don't increase the spread of the virus. I'm saying that crowds, wherever the crowds are, can give you an increased probability that there's going to be acquisition and transmission. But do you understand Americans' concern? Protesting, according, particularly according to the Democrats, is just fine, but you can't go to work, you can't go to school, you can't go to church. There's limits placed on all three of those fundamental activities, First Amendment activities, but protesting is just fine. The gentleman's time has expired, but now I'll just ask the gentleman to just think about his question and put it in reference to crowds that gather in political meetings at fundraisers without masks on an all-rig in Texas. Nobody wearing a mask, nobody's social distancing, but a fundraiser, right? Would that be problematic? With that, Agil, five minutes to Mr. Foster.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_294.mp3:  We have tried dog food. We have tried sardines. And nothing has caught this raccoon. This raccoon is literally driving me crazy you guys. It walked right off the back of the boat and onto my barbecue girl last night, which is right underneath my kitchen window and it was shaking its booty at me. It is literally taunting me at this point. I mean look at me, I'm a mess I haven't even shaved. This thing is literally taking over my life right now. It's all I can think about. So we've got to get this thing caught. Be sure to smash that subscribe button and hit the notification bell because I will be uploading all the videos that have to do with this boat going forward. We are going to be covering how the insurance company handles this situation because I do have full coverage on the boat and of course we will be uploading videos on the entire rebuild process. So you're going to want to see that, which leads me to a question for you guys. Do you think I should change the name of this channel to Mile High DIY? Originally I had wanted to do camping vlogs but the channel has just kind of swung the direction of DIY and project videos. So let me know what you think. Should I do two separate channels or just continue doing this channel as it is just change the name to Mile High DIY? Let me know. Really curious what you guys think. Alright, let's go try to catch the stinkin raccoon. Okay guys, tonight's setup. We've got one trap here with the Sardines and a marshmallow. Try next to my grill. Then I've thrown out a couple pieces of marshmallow and actually a couple pieces of hamburger meat and I threw it out on the cover hoping to bring it this direction. And then still got the oil and even some syrup on the ground now. And that goes out to the second trap that I've got set. This has the marshmallow maple syrup medley. So hopefully this will be good enough. We do have the backup plan if necessary. But hopefully we get him today. As you can see we got him.\n",

If it was a case of a white policeman killing a negro, criminal, it would be the end of the world, cities would burn, the whites would be massacred and that white person would be in jail for life. USA is one evil and terribly unjust country where white people are discriminated and horribly brainwashed, abused, exploited, and terrorized just for being white. Subhumans, negroes, mongolos, mongrels, have all the rights but white people, especially white men, have not. Worst of all, USA have been transferring all their factories, wealth, knowledge, and technology to China which will result in a total catastrophe, the sixth and final global or mass extinction event and the planet will die. Life will be terminated. Americans are an utter disgrace. Instead of protecting white people and championing white race, our advanced culture and civilization, they are actually tolerating and assisting or enabling subhumans, especially the Chinese, to destroy everything. They are letting China steal their election in front of the world as to place their corrupt and compromised puppets, China Joe and Negro Kamala, in power. Trump and USA are a bloody joke. Nonetheless, the Americans must fight China, arrest the traitors or US will die in the world with it.

He spent years on the run before he was finally caught in France in 1997. Einhorn was eventually brought back to Philadelphia where he was convicted for the murder. The cause of death is not yet known, but we're told it's not related to the virus outbreak. Ira Einhorn was 79.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_531.mp3:  Before I was even born, my father was in the Congress of the United States, Thomas DeLosandro Jr. He was a, okay, let's hear it for dad. He was a little teenager, a Shabbat boy. So he spoke Yiddish. He spoke Yiddish. So was he grew up in that and he was an art, a great speaker in all the rest. And he had a love for the idea of the Jewish state in what was then called Palestine. So when he was older and he went to Congress, this was one of his big issues. He worshipped at the shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a New Deal Democrat. He worshipped at the shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. But he disagreed with him on two very strong points. One was on the treatment of Jewish people in Europe that he wanted to call more attention to. And two, okay. He, as a second was the establishment of a Jewish state in what was then known as Palestine. He was part of something called a Berksening Group. Now some of you know this, some of you Marylander, since, and we've had shared this thought at other times, but I just want you to know that this support for US-Israel relationship is kind of in the DNA of our family, even before the establishment of the state of Israel. He went, he went on to become the mayor of Baltimore and support all of that. My brother would become the mayor of Baltimore. And he supported the state of Israel and US-Israel relationship as well. And has a, they say, stadium. I don't know if that means playing field, whatever. And HIFA, name for him, Thomas Dallesundra III. But one of the things that I think is so remarkable as I look back at my father part of this Berksening Group that went around, they had pageants and parades and rallies. Here he was, this art or speaking in Yiddish about, about the cause. When he was in the floor of Congress in June 22, 1942, he rose to speak about the state of Israel and he said, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the committee for a Jewish army, I speak huge on behalf of 200,000 fighting men who by divine destiny, then he goes on to say that they are fighting for the establishment of the state of Israel. So this was really a big deal for all of us. So while I do not have, cannot boast of Jewish grandparents as other speakers have and will and how fortunate they are, I do have my father's devotion and my brother's devotion to the cause, which is part of our family tradition. When I do have to boast of my Jewish grandchildren, I think I have the most of anyone in Congress, I'm not quite sure, but they are adorable, you might expect me to say. The U.S. Israel Partnership, let's hear it from my grandchildren.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_337.mp3:  The Sample of Lunar Soil Brought Back has a big impact on the Soviets' understanding of lunar geology. The results of the analysis shock Soviet geologists. It looked like something had happened to the soil in an area of the moon that was supposedly undisturbed for billions of years. What could it have been? Test on the sample confirmed that the soil used to be buried deep underground. One or something brought it to the surface. The Soviets know that the Americans haven't been to this part of the moon. They think this is their turf. So they have to face up to the question, who the heck's been disturbing the lunar surface here? Could someone else have landed on the moon before the US and Russia? I have heard that Germans developed a moon rocket before they were defeated in 1945. A fact from NASA's own records, the Germans had a very advanced space exploration program. The Nazis were leaders in the rocketry industry. And they had people like Warner von Braun. German aerospace engineer, Werner von Braun, is the founding father of rocket science. We're von Braun, was a genius. They've been a Nazi, but he was a genius. And was able to design systems that, to this day, are still astounding to us. During World War II, the Nazi regime asked von Braun to develop the V2 rocket, the first man-made craft to reach space. NASA and their Russian counterparts both know that this Nazi super-weapon was a key step in the development of their own moon rockets. We would not have been able to land on the moon if then meant for the Germans. Damn right. The first American rocket was based on V2 technology. The first Russian rocket was essentially just a V2. How difficult is it to believe that the Nazis pushed their technology just that little bit further?\n",

The next stage is crisis. With a wider change of power, structure, and economy, the period of normalization. This is what will happen in the United States. If you allow all the schmucks to put a big brother government in Washington DC, we will promise lots of things, never mind whether the promises are fulfilled or not. It takes only from 2 to 5 years to destabilize the nation. When they will see the future, what the beautiful society of the quality of social justice means and practice. Obviously they will reward. The time bomb is ticking. With every second, the disaster is coming closer and closer. The danger is real.\n",

First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand. Or if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry. Quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters. And then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime, which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows, so telling the blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn't help but agree.

You can see these users are from Israel. Here's another one trying to con the American public about what Israel is about. I'd like you to take a look at this link and see what they're doing. This is a coordinated effort. You might not believe it, but it is. The Israeli government's foreign ministry is involved in efforts to influence public opinion on the internet. Israel's foreign ministry orders internet propagandists so-called trainee diplomats to skew online polls and public forums to conform with the Israeli line. This is an organized effort using, quote, special megaphone software to alert hundreds of thousands of Jewish activists so they can manipulate internet websites and chat rooms to conform with the slant that already permeates mainstream media.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_108.mp3:  Yo, that's gonna mad me, Joffoo, Diesel Cast, so we dola with my amy right now, sir. What's wrong, man? Okay, I'm gonna have to say something about this right now. As you all may know by now, Black Friday is amongst us. Now for those of you who happen to not be living in this country, that'd be living in foreign countries, or just don't want somebody to have a damn clue, what the hell is Black Friday is, I'm gonna explain it to you, the best way I can. And just the Friday after a day's given day, where stores in America such as Macy's, JC Penney's, K-Mars, Walmart's Target, F-Y-E, etc. happens to drop all their prices from red to black, making all sales and prices at the lowest point of the year. So that way Americans can do their Christmas shopping good and save up a lot of money for the year. Yeah, sounds gravy, but this is the part where I say, fuck Black Friday. Being that most Americans are very lazy and they tend to do most of their Christmas shopping on Black Friday and no earlier. As a result, you'll get this big ass line of big pow, clustered people outside early in the morning, sometimes you'll even arrive earlier than that. Hell, they'll even sleep outside for hours, today's, so that way they can be the first ones in the store when as soon as they open up the door for the Black Friday sales. And then when they first open up the doors, as soon as they open up the doors, these people, these savages start running in the door like a bunch of animals treating the store like a goddamn zoo. It's barbaric as hell. If you think that I'm lying or you don't believe me or you think I'm joking, then watch this, see for yourself. This is proof how they act, really. Yeah. You see what I mean? Seriously, what's the point to all this? Sleeping outside for days in a cold, so that way you can save 70% off of a flat screen, 40 inch flat screen TV, which a little Call of Duty edition of your Xbox 360, which are little games. That is some bullshit. And you want to know what the satisfaction about this? People have literally got severely beaten up and sometimes killed just for getting what they want on Black Friday. And yet so many Americans wonder why so many foreign countries out there wonder why Americans are so damn dumb and barbaric. You know, the last time I checked, Shobble was meant to be very peaceful, not some wild grill of warfare in the jungle. Black Friday is pointless and stupid. And for all the people who act like this, I have to say that you're fucking stupid. You people are insane and you need to get a life because act like asshole savages is not having a life. And the way you guys brag about it on TV on the news isn't amusing. All right, it's just making you look even worse, okay? Staying in zone to tie Sean's own.\n",

It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly-knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. I call it the Infinity Machine, Quantum Computing. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headline. Its dissent is a silence, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. If you go all the way back to Howard Weiner, the goal of creating artificial intelligence was to create an all-seeing eye, a global computer that sees everything and to become gods. And the sentient world simulation SWS went live in 2007. Right now, we're inside a computer program. Is it really so hard to believe? These nanobots, these blood cell-sized devices will be going in our bodies. I will have some go inside our brains, so the capillary is not invasive. They'll be interacting with our biological neurons, they'll put our brains on the internet. And they'll also enable us to enter a virtual reality environment from within the nervous system. So if I want to go into a virtual reality environment, the nanobots will shut down the signals coming from my real eyes, my real skin, and create the signals that would be appropriate for the virtual environment. And then it'll feel like I'm in that environment. This... This isn't real? What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. If we have algorithms that stimulate the right things and give it the right data, they could reprogram you in a way without you even knowing it. We call it hallucinating, right? But these would be controlled hallucinations run by algorithms. So you think you're in control of your own will, but it's actually some evil AI or evil people controlling everything we do and we're more like zombies. You know? Like we think we're free and we're not actually free. It is called the sentient world simulation. The program's aim, according to its creator, is to be a continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the entire planet, complete with billions of nodes representing every person on the Earth. Targets and mind control victims have their minds linked up for life with conscious, super computers, which send a steady stream of bi-directional, low frequency, electromagnetic radiation to the target sphere. And what people have to realize is that these targeted individuals are basically the test stage for ruling all of this mapness out to all seven billion of us on this planet. And this was a white paper put out by Purdue University in 2006 and the sentient world simulation SWS went live in 2007, which represents every person on the planet within this computer matrix as a node. And every node is given an avatar and identifier. And that is real time 24-7 monitoring of every person on the planet. This is primarily but not exclusively facilitated by the a diabetic quantum computers produced by D-wave corporation. At the time of initial reports on the program, there were only 62 country-level simulations being run by the US Department of Defense. These simulations grouped humans into composites with 100 individuals acting as a single node. But already at that time, the US Army had used the systems to create a one-to-one-level simulation of potential army recruits. It's the stuff of a Hollywood movie, but a group of veterans has filed a lawsuit against the CIA and US Army claiming that the government planted remote control devices in their brains. The claims relate to a government program at the US Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. The ultimate aim would be to archive enough data on each individual to be able to make a computer model of everyone on the planet. The human genome will have a finite and hundreds of thousands of different genes across their species. And we backed them out in the human gene project. Well now it's the human mind project, the global brain project. You know, a present Obama just recently funded a whole bunch of scientists to decipher the mind. Well, our previous president, same thing George Bush, said the same thing. They're trying to decipher every possible thought and uniqueness due to culture and language and whatnot. And the goal is to make a cognitive model or map of the victim's brain. Ultimately, the system replicates and digitizes the will, intellect and emotions, the soul of the targets and downloads this back into the conscious computer. Robots the smartest people, artificial intelligence, AI. The idea is to port the software from the human brain. First, we're going to need lots of cheap fast parallel computers. Steve's referring to parallel processors about servers. What he did not state was that it is actually the quantum computer systems coming out of D-Wave that actually creates and drives this new matrix known as the SWS. It is not transistor based servers that run this. They are qubits, quantum bits. It is the SWS and D-Wave that comprises this new matrix. Second, we're going to need the scan individual human brains and find spatial and chemical detail to see exactly what cells are where connected or what or what type. We could scan my brain from inside, sending scan into the bloodstream, billions of them in the form of nanorobots and nanobots and capture every detail of my synapses, neurotransmitters and create a virtual recurs wall and a very powerful computer. And it would be indistinguishable from me. It would pass a recurs wall during test. And third, we're going to need computer models about each kind of brain cell works. We have input signals, changing interval state and sending output signals. We have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells and a good enough model of brain. We can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain. And that model would have the same input output behavior as the original. So if you talk to it, if I talk back, if you ask us to do things and I do them, if we could do that, everything would change. The Manhattan Project gave us the atomic bomb. The genome project gave us the human genome. The third great initiative could be the Connect Dome project to map the entire human brain. And that may take a quantum computer. OK, the first thing I can tell you is that M has spent most of their life in virtual reality. While this is what you would look like in virtual reality, this is what an M would look like when virtual reality. It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere. But still, it could see and experience the same thing. But some things are different for M's. And M can make an archive copies. And with enough redundant archives, an M can be immortal, imprinable, though not usually in practice. And an M can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain from one physical location to another. M's can actually move around the world at the speed of light. And by moving to another location, they can interact more quickly with M's near that new location. And the simulation is really what we talk about in the SWS as the nodes, the avatars, every single person on the planet. OK, out of Purdue University's own paper in 2006, every person is assigned a avatar. They're represented computationally in the AI system that drives the SWS as a computer node that they're given an avatar marker. Take the avatar and hang the word emulation on it. In other words, they've been tracking us. They've been reproducing our metadata for years. We can model every single atom, every single molecule with a three-dimensional structure in every single brain. They claim they've modeled the personality of every adult in the United States, 230 million people. And SCL, the mothership group, they do work in any number of countries. They're involved in politics in many countries. They put together a micro-shot personality assessment for everyone. M's are very much like humans, but they are not like the typical human. The typical M is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans. If you construct a model of the human brain, you can then plug people into this hive mind. You could, as an intermediate step, take these duplicated neurons, artificial warm and wet qubits, as I call them, and you can integrate those into an actual human mind. Sometimes you are able to control that human mind with artificial neurons and then have those minds connected to each other, just like you network in daisy chain computer systems, that is the hive mind. And this means that in the future communications could be done mentally. What I'm saying is that the internet will be replaced by brainnet. They control the mind the same way that they teach the AI computer systems at the high level of AI. We're not talking about cars, trains, planes, and automobiles. We're talking about AI that is so sophisticated that it operates essentially in world simulation. So sophisticated that it actually taps in and controls the mind. And Google was the primary interested party that pulled this whole thing together. What they're going to do is apply this machine to an area that I think is fundamentally important. It's the crux of our future as humans. And that's can we build machines like us? We can model every single model with the three-dimensional structure in your entire brain. At level precision we'll keep advancing to the point where it's absolutely indistinguishable, even at the very microscopic levels. You could recreate an entity that's even if you look inside of it, it's simulated brain will be processing information just the way I do. If you start looking at quantum computing and where it's going, it's pretty freaky sort of stuff. And thinking about the world as an electrical universe and the fact that we are energetic electrical beings, that's how we work. Everything is electrical. Every signal that runs through our body is electricity. Everything we have, everything we feel, everything we touch, everything we speak, it's all the result of electromagnetic signals flooding around our body. Impulse is a come from our heart, from our brain. The way we feel a bench when we touch it, this is an electrical signal that's sent to your brain that tells you what the bench feels like. So it's all electromagnetic. It's all firing of electromagnetic through our snapsets and all this sort of stuff. The adiabatic quantum computer is linked to 7 billion human brains. It is now in its own language of cryptology able to function independent of any oversight throughout the world with its own form of communication and its own form of code. And it is able to link everyone on the planet at this point. We can model every single atom, every single molecule with a three dimensional structure in every single brain. They claim that modeled the personality of every adult in the United States, 230 million people, and SCL, the mothership group. They do work in any number of countries. They're involved in politics in many countries. They put together a micro-shot personality assessment for everyone. What I am principally is not this material stuff, but a pattern of information. Well, then if the pattern is the essence, and if you copy the pattern to whatever level of precision you need, then that copy that has the exact same pattern should be made. They're running everything that's happening in society, parallel, and they've got a little dot in their matrix for everybody. This is a game society. They know where it's been, they know where it's going, and they know where it's going because they're steering people into the direction it wants to go. There are an enormous number, mind-bogglingly large number, of parallel realities. Real is this one that have different consistent histories. So imagine a world where all of the laws of physics, as we know, the moral bathe, but different decisions were made along the way. Different decisions at the level of tiny microscopic particles, different decisions all the way up to what you chose to eat for lunch, and whether you chose to come to the session or not. This is a lot of cool from 10 years ago. Sentient world, war games on the ground is scale. The DOD is developing a parallel to planet Earth with billions of individual nodes to reflect every man, woman, and child, this side of the dividing line between reality and AR. It's absolutely indistinguishable, even at the very microscopic levels. You could recreate an entity that's, even if you look inside of it, it's simulated brain will be processing information just the way I do. Each state has merged the quantum computer with the sentient world simulation, and the true reason for all this data collection is to feed it into this AI machine to predict and manipulate the course of humanity. Their ability to look at data in a quantum, artificial intelligence manner, it's just going to be an unstoppable monster. And this is bizarre because we don't see those other things. Science has reached the point now where we can build machines that exploit those other worlds. So, Google was set up 18, 19 years ago to build a giant artificial supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into it with the internet of science. And so all of our thoughts go into it. And yes, they're in the cloud, but it's actually encrypted and kept private for you and we do a pretty good job with that. And we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures. We are connected as an organic computer. I mean, this is one of the most conspired, quote unquote, conspiracy theories that's been around for many, many, many, many years, decades. But the reality is we're now facing the reality of that. It is no longer a conspiracy and quite frankly, it's terrifying. And now the sentient world simulation is watching you learn about it. And inside its intelligent mind is creating a second view running different scenarios against you to see how you react.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_256.mp3:  So someone watches Episode 1 and food at the end. What do you want them to learn as they're sat there on their sofa? I think one of the things is that survival is engender specific actually. You know, women might approach stuff differently to men, but really it's about this, it's about heart and character and I'm all about being independent, not you know, relying on men for anything, but fire is really important and the way that they have their camp set up, they have an area to put wood to keep dry. They have all the things they need to cook food. They keep their fire going because it's right by their bed. I mean, they just have a really good system going for them and we don't. You get to see the differences. I'm being quite careful not to make it sort of a battle of the sexism, let people draw their own conclusions. It sucks that we need the boys for some things. Unfortunately, there's things that we really need from them and I hate that it's always like a bargain. Well, what can we get from you? It's just so annoying. I don't know what their mentality is every time they ask for something, they act like they deserve it and they make it sound like we are taking more from them than they offer us, which is completely ludicrous. So every time we turn around, they're warning something. In a quid pro quo situation, someone in a position of power demands sexual favors in exchange for job benefits. You just want just a minute of warmth and then you can just struggle through it and when the boys said that they didn't want us around standing around their empire anymore. Unless sexual favors are given, there'll be a loss of job benefits. We have so many people writing in saying you've got to do a women's version and I thought Hallelujah, brilliant. This is what we really want to do. We've been crap done since we've been here. We got zero sleep last night. We stayed up the entire night, froze, soaking wet and we haven't had to fire because it rained and put it out. So now we haven't eaten. So that heart and character and determination and that's not just a main of a woman or a man. I was thankful last night that we stuck to our guns a little bit after a tribal and didn't run over and jump in the men's shelter. But going over there this morning, I have no shame. I've never been so miserable. I couldn't get my tail over there to that fire fast enough. Come on, come on, baby. This is a very high fall. Make sure you keep your arms to your chest and land on your back. Here we go. Bill, just, just, just. Go, Nina. Come to Alicia. Leave right now. He gives it a go. Courtney, were the serious injury holding that wrist? Come on. Courtney, are you okay? I don't think I can be either. Alright, everybody hold up. Okay, so it's unclear right now what it is for sure until you x-ray you won't know, which means we're not sure her status in the game at this point. So why don't you take her out of here? Alright, men, no tribal council tonight. Grab your stuff, have back to camp. Women, I'll see you tonight at tribal. It was like heartbreak. Those guys don't give a crap about any of us girls and it showed it today. They don't care. We're not letting those muscles discourage us at all. Let's load up the stuff, guys. Girls, if we all just keep our head in the game and try to stay, you know, together and just take the boys down, then we'll just be one huge ball of bad assness. We're going to do 1000 years later. This season's Battle of the Sexes hasn't been a battle at all. The men's tribe is one every challenge. Bad assness. Words of words, but actions or actions. Image or clothes or makeup, whatever our sort of stuff is. You know what, it's not what we are. You know, what we are is beyond all of them. Chelsea and I needed to wash our hair with fresh water so we can look shiny and clean. What people look like, it matters. You know, there's like lots of studies that have been done on that. So we thought if we put fresh water in our hair, our chances go up, up, up. The reality is if you're real masculine, a number of women today are offended by that. It's the bare presence of pure unadulterated manliness and furiorate some women today. When it on a charming man, I said what I said, if you don't understand the logic or if you don't agree with the logic, go ahead and do what you're doing. I'm just trying to make sure I heard you correctly. Does it matter the water? Damn it. Shut up for a minute. I'm not in a good mood. Just shut up. Relax, man. Can you not do that right now? You can relax, man. It'll be okay. We started working on our shelter and lo and behold as always, some of the girls came over and were like, can we bar in amber from our fire? They didn't have fire. I don't think any of the girls want to stand over there. It's uncomfortable mooching off of them. I mean, they're all like, excuse me, move, move. I literally just want to somebody to punch me so I can get in and not jump. Talking about where we haven't been warm all night, blah, blah, blah. We're stuck in wet, we're cold, we're freezing. So the guys have just, I guess, had to get this mindset like no more deals. It's off. This is a game. We want to be nice, but again we're playing for a million bucks like screw these girls. I went out grab hunting this morning and came back and found situated the girls in our shelter underneath our stuff sitting on our beds, you know, soaking wet, you know, sitting by our fire. I need to bar your car right quick. What kind of shit is that? Most people on a bar are sugar. They even catch up. You want a bar in my car? Hell no. The worst thing in the world to me is being wet and cold and it's been like that for a long time. Crying is a waste of water. Everyone's different, you know, I mean, the women gets really quite feral and shocking actually in a way that I'd never anticipated. This fucking scene shall we? Put this back in the sink. Erica starts throwing away some of the group's firewood. She's lost her mind. Put this back in the sink. It's just bizarre. What is going on? She's now going to push some wood in the sea. Oh my god, I am so fucking sorry. One of the women on the island, which was them, because I can't afford to cry anymore, it's dehydrating me. I feel such a dick. You want to hear my hear off? Oh, thank you, Jack. When they're tired, they beat me up, they just crumble. You know, I haven't determined how these can't do it. We are a team here, aren't we? Apart from Jane. You know what we're dealing with hormonal irrational women right now? It's not even worth trying to negotiate and at this point I'm done. Every time we caught a fish, it was like a big hurrah. Like, we know we can do something that the boys have been doing every day. Stab a crocodile, gut it, and then carry it out of the jungle. With the glass ceiling broken, all the oppressed groups shall prosper. So me and Troy go over to the women's tribe, and we propose that they let us use them. Because they obviously don't know how to use the net. So they go over, me and Troy go over and we say, listen, if you let us use the net, we'll give you 50% of whatever we catch. I'm just like a 50 fish. That's enough. Everybody can have two, three fish each in both tribes. So, he doesn't have a swab way about asking things. What we want to do now, we're not pushing the issue. What we're going to do is just let them fumble around for a few more days and not catch fish. And they'll come back, and when they come back, the deal's different. It's not 50-50 anymore because they're coming back to us. The deal's more like... Is that all? What do you mean, is that all? What the hell you want to hand job? I want to fuck you up the edge. You can stick it up your own ass hole. I wonder if I could. Bitch. Every day, our number one priority is shelter. And we're so overworking on our shelter and it's still just, it's not. We got rained on all night last night. It's like every time we go to bed, we dread it because we know we're just going to be sitting there miserable. Soak and wet and cold until the sun comes up. When the girls came back over today, they were absolutely freezing. I mean, I couldn't stop thinking about them last night because I just knew that they were absolutely freezing to death. And then they come over in the morning and they're absolutely frozen to death. And it just...it pisses me off and I just...it's just not right. And that was just, I mean, outright wrong. We shouldn't...we just shouldn't do that. As I want to help them as much as I can. Because that's what is being a man. That's what is being a gentleman. That's what is being chivalrous. Why the hell would you ever align with a bunch of girls? But I think that's kind of a man thing to do. We're really kind of thinking it through like systematically what we have to do, like, you know, the army or something.\n",

I was not expecting to see this guy's face in the news because I actually know him. Or more so new him. If you don't know about this, I see this. You go back and watch that video. But I'm here to tell you why he's a fraud and this is bullshit. First off, he claims that Antifa attacked him because he went to a protest not choosing sides instead being in the center. And that's not the case at all. During the first Trump election, he was actually very forbred until Hillary got chosen as the Democratic League. But in the middle of that, something changed. And it wasn't his Antifa attack because that was within the last two years. He's been extremely right-wing ever since then. Starting fights on Facebook and even problems with people in public. Secondly, he says he got attacked. He's actually a very, very well-trained kickboxer. In fact, at a national and professional level. How do I know this? Because I'm a kickboxer as well. In fact, this is me and him in 2013 getting ready to weigh in for the WK National Tournament. I'm fighting you more because his coach, Chris Trayon, and I weapons 9 in New Jersey actually kicked him out. Lastly, there's this Twitter post that shows him right after he beat up protesters, bragging about it. Directly before going to the cops and claiming that he was the victim. I can't believe people are making excuses for him. If you're not sure that guy in the clown makeup is, that's Paul Miller. Okay, if you're not sure of the backstory, please go back and check this guy's profile. He's talking about this gypsy crusader here, this guy Paul Miller. Now, as you can see, he's sitting here next to my son. We know this guy because he was an established, Moitai fighter and kickboxer. His instructor being a very well-known Asian American instructor. Hearing about this guy being very well-known as a racist and this gypsy crusader who stands against Black Lives Matter and people who look like me. And then knowing all that we've done for this young man makes me happy to know that his instructor kicked him out of the gym not once, not twice, but three times. And it makes me sick to hear and see so many people standing up for this dude.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_524.mp3:  A 12 year old African American girl says that her classmates called her hair ugly and nappy as they pinned her down and cut several of her dreadlocks. CNN's Rene Mars spoke to Amari Allen and her family about what happened. 12 year old six-grader Amari Allen is healing after she says three white male classmates at a manual Christian school in Springfield, Virginia targeted and attacked her because of her hair. It was about to go down one of the sides when three boys came up to me, like, swarrowed me and they put me on the ground. One of them put my hands on my back, one put their hands over my mouth and one cut my hair. The alleged attack on school grounds was both physical and verbal. They were saying like, my hair was ugly, it was nappy, they were saying that I don't deserve to live, I shouldn't have been born. The back of it was in the middle of her back and they cut all of these. Her grandmother says she was targeted for being different. They attacked her as, as whom God created her to be, as a young lady of color. Amari says it was the school bell that saved her when it rang. We're enough laughing, went back to the line and I just got myself up and went back to one. It started the first day of school when they start taking her lunch and eating her lunch in front of her, telling her, these nasty words, you're not fit to live. Yeah, you're not fit to live. You're ugly, you're hair is nappy. You don't belong here. The school told CNN an statement, we take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all of our students and have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse. The student body there is 52 percent white and 11 percent African American. Emanuel Christian made news earlier this year because second lady Karen Pence teaches art part time there despite a school policy that bans gay students and parents. Pence's office defended her decision to work there. The Allen family filed a police report and the Fairfax County Police Department tells CNN they are now investigating. You realize that you are beautiful, right? And you realize that your hair is beautiful too, right? In the meantime Amari's family says they are reminding her daily that she is enough, trying to reverse the negative impact of the painful words from her classmates. These to say sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt, words will kill. There's a lot of people today that have committed suicide of a one-word. So words have deep scarring. Well Amari missed a few days of school as a result of this incident, but she plans to return and the school told CNN those involved in the incident will be out of school while police continued their investigation. Now the family says that they do forgive these students, but they want to see them receive some sort of punishment and counseling so that they never do this to anyone else again. Renee Marsh, CNN, Washington.\n",

They have killed more people on American soil and caused more damage on American soil than ISIS and al-Qaeda combined. And yet Black Lives Matters gets to burn down cities, loot, rob and pillage, and people tolerating it. That's ridiculous. We've shown stand for it. As Americans, we need to stand up and say when the Ford industry gives them $300 million, we say, fuck Ford. That's simple. They're not standing on the side of love. They're spreading hate, domestic terrorism. The 1964 civil rights riots are still going on as Black Lives Matters riots today. You know what we think about all that? The bottom American pride. Loving our people, white lives matter. Black lives aren't even contributing right now. All they're doing is tearing up, destroying. Destroying what again? Oh yeah, the nation we built. They robbed, they loot, they pillage. There are legal ways to demonstrate. White lives matter has over had over 20 some international rallies and national rallies. Not one law was violated. Black lives matter can't held any kind of protest or demonstration without looting, pillaging and murdering. They try to say that rape. Somehow rape is justified. Comes down to it. Americans got to be proud of who we are and just say what it is. White lives matters. Black lives matters has denounced all lives matters and white lives matters as even matter. So if you agree that all lives matter, obviously white lives matter. And Black lives matters is a terrorist organization.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_580.mp3:  In a five-year period, 122 workers died. Thai workers in the Israeli agricultural sector. I was at a Moschal the day after a worker died in a sleep. He'd been working 17 hours a day, seven days a week, and he'd been given four days off per year. In all of the cases that we encounter until now, that a Thai worker had died in his sleep, nobody went to actually check how many hours he worked in that day, with kind of accommodation they had if he was spraying or not spraying best decides. What concerns is greatly is whether or not these living and working conditions are contributing to the very problematic pattern of death. There are approximately 25,000 Thai workers in Israel right now, almost exclusively doing all the work in Israel's agricultural sector. Since 2011, when Israel signed the bilateral agreement with the Government of Thailand, it's only been Thai workers who've been coming in. We need them for our economy. The far away we've shot their field and shot their business if they don't have workers, and only foreign workers come to work in our agriculture. So we have to treat them as our guests and to take care of them. When we visit these workers, you keep finding the same problems. The workers living in really squalid accommodation. Before he was still, they put in the chemicals and the motor and everything, but he kept inside. The farmer would usually just let the workers live in the cheapest place he can find. His old packaging house, his old warehouse, his old chicken houses. It's usually in the backyard of every big villa, in every village. If we go to go into the toilet, we go into our house, under the tree, 19. So there was no toilet, no toilet. Thirty-year-old, 40-year-old men and women that are here to work for five years and three months are supposed to be their home. And none of the farmers and me or any Knesset member were allowed their kids to sleep in these places. Okay. We conducted my survey among 500 workers. No one was getting minimum wage. We said that the workers had to pay for the rent. Workers have to spray pesticides. Many of the workers we spoke to were clearly not given adequate protection when they did that. In the summer when it's outside, it can get up to 35, 40 degrees. And then in there, it gets up to 60 degrees. It's very, very hard to breathe in the situation. Workers are working incredibly long hours in incredible heat. And in some cases, there's this great concern that workers may not be being worked to death. The employer is fully aware that the likelihood of any prosecution for inviolating workers' rights is very low. So if he wants to make a worker work for 20 hours a day, he can. When you have excellent laws in place, you have the perception that this is a very well regulated sector. But if those laws aren't properly enforced, then you move quickly to a very badly regulated sector. This should be an office or a department that said we are responsible with the only one that responsible for the foreign workers. They come here for five years, they leave their families, they leave their kids, and they deserve to be treated properly, to be treated according to the law. And they deserve not to be subjected to living and working conditions that place their lives at risk.\n",

So listen carefully this is part of the program where they tell you about what it's really doing and we're going to analyse it. Just three miles away the laser seems to have risen by six feet but we know the beam is level so that suggests that the lake is now six feet lower. To see a six foot drop when everything looked flat to me was was kind of mind boggling. Definitely kind of shattered my perspective in about one second and made me rethink what was going on. Guys if the laser is three meters on the boat and the laser is a straight line it has to be three meters off the ground because it's a straight line that's what they came in. If it's a straight line the laser also has to be three meters off the ground if there's a a bulge in the middle because that's what they're saying. If the laser is below that means the boat has to be bigger. The boat would have to increase in its size for the laser to project onto the boat. You see you can't have a lopsided bulge between the boat and the laser. I mean in fact these people are the whole show is fake. There are things a lot of rubbish. If you move the boat and the laser if you move the laser 20 degrees to your right the boat is the same distance from the laser you'll get a different reading. You can't have a bulge of water between yourself and about because at this angle you live a different reading. So even if they say to you well no you just move the bulge forward now see problem solved. The bulge can't follow the laser and the bulge can't follow the boat. So this stuff is fake it's not a real science it's propaganda. But we know that team is level. But we know that team is level. So now these globalist propagandist what they're doing is they swapped the boat for a helicopter and the laser for a telescope. And they're telling the helicopter to fly out further and now they're going to make the helicopter drop below the curve of the water. Now think about how ridiculous this is. This is supposed to be a science lesson to prove that the water is curved. Think about how stupid this is. As it land this is so it's insane. So the helicopter drops below the line of sight. How can the trees still be of the helicopter and the mountains still be in the same place? Because it's simple. The helicopter needs to fly from right to left and you would see it go below the bulge and then you'd see it reappear on the left side of the bulge. Then understand or otherwise the bulge of water in front of the museum tube. Then understand how stupid this whole thing is. This whole experiment is just propaganda. It's fake. It's nonsense. Perception is still it's a flat lake. But it's not a flat lake. It's not a flat lake. That was crazy. I was definitely blown away by the fact that the laser was that high off the water. Look this is a deer. These animals when the lake freezes over they can get stuck. Once they lose their footing they try to get up and then eventually they lose strength. And unfortunately if they don't rescue them in time they have to put the animal down. So the issue is if there's a ball of water, if the water is bent this animal would never be able to get stuck in the middle of the lake. Because he was just slid down. Because remember in the experiment the two shores on the same line. And now do you understand how ridiculous their claim is? You see wolves walk across the lake. When the lake is frozen people are scared on the lake. I think about it. Could this lady skate on a ball, an ice ball that he's spinning at 1066 km an hour and hurtling through space at 110,000 km an hour and these people just willingly to skate calmly on a ball of frozen water. Just think. Or is it propaganda? What are your eyes see? What does your mind tell you? And what are they telling you? They're telling you the truth. I was a propaganda. You need to think about these things. You see is the meter being controlled? If the meter is being controlled you need to think about what you watch. If you're watching violent programs, if you're playing violent TV games, it's going to make you violent. If you watch stupid, it's going to make you stupid. Don't watch TV blindly and blankly with a blank mind because you're allowing them to program you. Think about how direction wonder why you haven't now. Now stand in the place where you were. Now face where. Think about the place where you live wonder why you haven't people. If you are confused, check with the sun. Carry a compass to help you along. Your feet are going to be on the ground. Your head is there. So, OREM, the band OREM, rapid arm movement, and it happens when you force the sleep. So what are they telling you? I shame that for compass to work, it's supposed to be flat. Everybody's on the same plane. They're also pointing at something to you in about direction. Where is north? It's not in the middle. You need to think about it. So at least they're the courage and the strength to go against the flow and say something's wrong. You see, we're not being told the truth. The people who control the system truth and what is right and justice isn't on the agenda. Manipulation and deceit is what they do. So I hope this makes you think and cheers and thanks for watching.\n",

Well, in the news right now. Absolutely, Jack. Nothing. Out when Stolzeneetson, a man who survived decades of Soviet gulags, said the reason that we don't know about the 50 million dead Slavic Christians, white men and women and boys and girls, is because those people and their descendants who committed the largest genocide in history at the time are currently in control of the mechanisms of our electoral process and our media. Want you to think long and hard before you start casting votes for candidates who won't talk about what the hell's going on with industrial scale child molestation in our country. I think long and hard. Why is this not the media? Well, I can tell you why, because some Murdoch who run newscorp, including Fox News, or Orthodox Jews, because Zucker at CNN is a Jew, the oxal salt purpose, the class be voting shareholders. But the New York Times are fucking Jews, because almost all of the damn news anchors are fucking Jews. Strongly encourage all of you to get in shape. I spend an hour or two swimming in open water today. I bike about six to ten miles and I practice shooting my fucking weapons, because it's about to be 1776, if these fucking pedophiles and Jews who are grooming children for them aren't removed from the halls of power. I'll tell you which office I'll be running for next. Anyhow, God bless America and God damn Israel. Go out and name the Jew. Now return the singoff.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_635.mp3:  It's been one month since activists in Washington, D.C. painted Black Lives Matter on a street not far from the White House with the blessing of the district government. Now the conservative non-profit judicial watch is suing the city's mayor, Muriel Bowser and others citing a First Amendment violation after their request to paint a political message was denied. The judicial watch president Tom Hitton joins me now. Tom, what did you want to paint on the street? Well, it's our motto at judicial watch. It's our motivation because no one is above the law. It doesn't get any more apolitical than that. We wanted to paint it on a street near our offices here on Capitol Hill, just a few blocks away from the studio. And the mayor and her office gave us the run around for three weeks. So we sued. Now remember, the city painted Black Lives Matter. The city also allowed to be painted as well defund the police. So it's hard to argue that that can take place yet a request like we're making can't. And so when you start denying access to a public forum now, which the streets are according to the mayor's own actions, you're running up against the First Amendment. That's why we're in federal court. I want to read to you a part of a response from a George Washington University professor Paul Schiff-Berman. He writes, if you create a true public forum and you let lots of people protest there, then of course the government can't favor some sorts of speech over other sorts of speech. But this is not a public park. This is the government itself choosing to speak. The government painted the Black Lives Matter painting on the street and when the government is speaking, they're not required to allow space for alternative viewpoints. I find that point of view a little surprising since when is the government always right? Well, especially since they allowed that group to paint defund the police. You know, we asked the go through the rule. We promised to go through the rules. Said, you know, if we need a permit, we'll get the permit. If we need paint, we'll buy the paint. We'll do everything necessary to comply with the law to get this message there. And the government obviously can have certain restrictions about how it's done. They initially said, well, I don't know if it will work because it might interfere with traffic. I said, well, you know, let's, we can close the street. Is there a way to get a street closed? There's a street that's closed now outside the White House evidently to protect this painting. Can we get an option there? And we're just getting the run around. We were told to call, to deal with their permitting office. And they said, well, we don't know anything about a permit like that. And it's not just in DC. We warned up in New York City. We warned Mayor DiBlasio, who's also planning to paint similar messages across the city. We want to access to. We want to paint on Fifth Avenue. What's to prevent? I don't know. Somebody from coming in and say, okay, now this week you need to paint to Native American Lives Matter on the streets of Washington, DC. Nothing. This is the consequence when a government or starts playing games. And you know, if they're going to start picking winners and losers on speech issues, informs they're now opening up to the American people. The result is they got to follow the law. And we're trying to hold the government accountable to the law. It looks to me like the DC Mayor doesn't want our message to be out there because she disagrees with it. And that's not proper under the Constitution. All right, Tom Fitton. You have hit a roadblock so far with the city, but let us know the outcome of your suit. Thanks for coming on. We'll do it. Thanks, Scott.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_609.mp3:  Are you in control of your mind or are others? When we choose to watch television, go to the movies, listen to pop music, read certain books, and consume other forms of toxic culture, we see at least partial control of our systems, as we do not have the proper firewalls in place to deal with all of the overt and covert messages. Subliminals, predictive programming, and emotional triggers are put into media to change your thinking and therefore your actions. For far too long others have projected their will upon us, often through the use of literal projection screens. So it is important to realize how easily we are affected by electromagnetic manipulation, especially as recent developments have led to mind control technology that can project voices inside your head. Don't believe me, look it up. Imagine a war of the world's scenario that does not actually involve radio, but holograms, nanotech, and mass mind control technology. Mind control is not all that hard to achieve, even using simple means. In order to demonstrate this I am going to perform an experiment with you all. I know this might seem a bit silly, but please do bear with me. I need your participation in order for this to be effective. First, please think of a stuffed purple elephant, like burning, but with big ears and a long trunk. Now I want you to touch your nose with your right pointer finger, and I am not testing to see if you are drunk. Don't worry. Keep it there for three seconds. One, two, three. Now, maybe I did not get you all to touch your finger to your nose, but I did get you to think of an elephant version of Barney, didn't I? Through the vibratory waves of my voice and my moving image, I was able to fire certain neurons in your brain, creating a mental image, and initiating a cascade electrical signals that likely resulted in your finger moving exactly how I wanted it to move. This is just a very simple experiment to show how one person is able to use their power to influence others. You are far more powerful and influential than you might think. You are actually a being of great luminosity. An easy way to show this is with one of those stationary bikes hooked up to a light bulb. Through just a little bit of effort, you are able to take the energy stored inside you and light up a dark room. Hopefully, there is a light bulb going off in your head as you start to realize the implications of this all. Your power goes far beyond the boundaries of your skin, your bioelectric field, or the life energy some call Chi, extends beyond your material body, as can be seen visually with curly and photography. Another good way to demonstrate how you can influence others from a distance is through the use of your voice. You can talk to someone on the other side of the room and get in their head. Or shout and raise an alarm that has heard four miles. When you consider how we are able to use the internet now to utilize our voice around the world, this really is a power that we should not underestimate. Even just your presence, the sight of you, perhaps your powerful smile or your glare, can have a profound effect upon others at a distance. Let us regain control of our minds, realize our power, increase it, and use our influence to awaken and activate as many other people as possible. We need to break the spell we have been under once and for all. Let us expose and overthrow the dark sorcerers who have been ruling over us for far too long.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_344.mp3:  Our Moon, a strange thing, don't you think? Have you ever gazed upon a full moon and wondered, wondered how it got there, what strange forces could have possibly built it? There are many moons within our solar system, yet few are as strange as ours. No others are known to ring like a bell when struck. No others possess such luminosity as our moon. In the 1970s, Michael Vassen and Alexander Shashirbakov of what was then the Soviet Academy of Sciences, created a thesis that the moon is actually the remnants of a very ancient spaceship created by, as yet, a known civilization. The article was entitled, Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence, and was published in Sputnik, the Soviet equivalent of Reader's Digest. The suggestion of a hollow moon first appeared in science fiction when H. G. Wells wrote about a hollow moon in his 1901 book, The First Men in the Moon. Michael Vassen and Alexander Shashirbakov's hypothesis is based on the fact that large lunar craters generally assume to be formed from massive meteor impacts are generally too shallow for scars made upon an organic body and can have flat or even convex bottoms. They propose that small meteors are making cup-shaped depressions in the rocky surface of the moon, while the larger meteors are drilling through a rocky upper layer, hitting an armored hull underneath. Does George Lucas know something we don't? It seems he couldn't resist adding just one crater. The author's referenced earlier speculations by astrophysicist Yosef Shiklovsky, who suggested that the Martian moon Phobos was an artificial satellite and hollow. Interestingly, Phobos has been claimed to appear to be hollow by numerous astronomers, who have stated that it appears to have an opening on one side, making it, in a sense, similar in shape to an empty shell. Phobos' orbit is also a complete mystery. Many who have researched it claimed that it should have crashed into the surface of Mars many moons ago. Between 1972 and 1977, seismometers installed on our moon by the Apollo missions recorded strange moonquakes. The moon was described to have been ringing like a bell during some of those quakes. The supportive evidence was then brought to popular attention in March 1970, in an article in popular science. When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed the ascent stage of its lunar module into the moon's surface, it was claimed that the moon rang like a bell for an hour, leading to arguments that it must be hollow. Several YouTubers, most notably Crow 777, have supposedly recorded what is now known as lunar waves, if confirmed to exist. This may prove there is some form of functioning shield or scanning system being seen working on its surface. The fact that the moon is less dense than the Earth is also strong supportive evidence that it is indeed hollow.\n",

It was peaceful it was very peaceful but what really strikes you is just how exposed how defenseless everybody was. The afternoon prayer and every day custom inside the El Nore Mosque for Muslims like Muhammad Ishmael and ordinary ritual in an extraordinary place. Even today now when we sit down I can hear the sound of the gun in my ears you know. On that Friday of March the 15th they were on their knees like this facing mecca their backs turned to the gunman. We had this sound like a light cracking or something like that you know so everybody look what position were you sitting down like that. If all I did was look back like that. This room was full of the faithful. This room was also full with women and children. The gunman marching down the hallway to kill being here the reality is they were just so so vulnerable. All we could see was the smoke in the three gunshots. Bloodshed in chaos unleashed. When you were lying you know when you hear this gunshots you know the smell of gunpowder that was really frightening. I can feel the winds sort of you know I could have been the bullets going you know all my hair. Muhammad Ishmael caught in that stampede. There I was you know exactly this place on this side. Yeah and people were just working on me. Covered in bodies for two minutes he came free then a gift. I managed to climb this tree. I just climbed this tree yeah. He was lucky so many were not. Your friend is shot on the side. Indeed. Tonight every one of the hundreds of bullet holes has been covered out. Gone the moss though still standing. It's going to be there for a long time in nobody can ever take this one from us. The mosque on Deans Avenue. Unbreakable. Now I want to tell you something about Muhammad Ishmael who's in that story there. This is much more than a mosque to him because he is actually one of the community leaders who helped create this place. One of three community leaders who came up with the idea who raised the money who found the land and actually built this so that people could come. Muhammad Ishmael the thought of him having to be forced to escape out of here was friends were killed around him as he prayed in his favorite spot and scrambled over a tiny little tree. I'm sure everybody would agree is just playing wrong. So when he says that nobody can ever take this mosque away from them you know that Muhammad Ishmael means that with every little piece of his heart. Patrick thank you.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_620.mp3:  The White House is preparing Americans for a sharp spike in the death toll due to the coronavirus, with one official comparing it to the horrific terrorist attacks in New York City two decades ago. It's tragically fitting that we're talking at the beginning of Holy Week because this is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans' lives, quite frankly. This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9-11 moment only. It's not going to be localized. It's going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that. The White House anticipates a death toll in the US of between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. The surgeon general said the mitigation efforts of the population, including in many places staying at home and so-called social distancing, was helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He urged the nine states that do not have statewide stay-at-home orders to implement some short-term mechanism to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, if only temporarily to free up parts of the healthcare system. In recent weeks, the message from President Donald Trump in his daily press briefings has been that the White House has this situation under control. But Sunday we heard another version of that from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We are struggling to get it under control. And that's the issue that's at hand right now. The thing that's important is that what you see is increases in new cases, which then start to flatten out. But the end result of that, you don't see for days if not weeks down the pike. Further Dr. Fauci worried that the coronavirus could become seasonal. He said that there was a very small chance that the coronavirus would be completely contained or completely eliminated. So once this crisis dies down, it could come roaring back later this year or next year, and that patent could be repeated until a vaccine is found. Toby Mews, CGTN, Washington.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_634.mp3:  Molly Conlon, a child actor turned to Instagram model, was recently held at knife point while thugs raided her home. She wrote about the situation on Twitter, quote, so I didn't know whether to write a post or not, but my mom saying it's the best thing to do as you never know if it is going to happen to you. At three o'clock today, I was in my house when I got a knock on the door. I opened it thinking it was a delivery man. Two tall black men barged in. Pushing me to the ground, dragging me upstairs and held me at knife point while raiding my house. I was literally praying as I thought I was going to die. All the time I told her I know, two had come through the back of my house also and found my brother's car keys and later all jumped into his black Audi A1 and took my phone and a watch. They were screaming at me, telling me they was going to hurt me if I didn't give them anything while I was begging for my life being pinned down to the floor. When I called the police for my neighbor's phone, they come and later found my phone ditched and caressing. Please, can everyone lock their front doors as I see this happen on Facebook the other day and never thought this would happen to me. End quote. On her Twitter profile, she regularly demonizes the police and she retweeted someone who was ridiculing white women for not wanting the police to be abolished. Then two weeks later, she was begging for her life and ran to her neighbor's house crying for the police. As I've said before, liberal women are mentally sick. They want to abolish the police, but the moment a man takes advantage of them, they cry for the police. These type of women end up learning the hard way and Molly's case is a great example. During 2018 in the United States, 59,778 blacks were violently victimized by whites. Whereas 547,948 whites were violently victimized by blacks. The fact is, blacks commit almost 10 times more interracial violent crimes against whites, yet what does Molly have to say about this? She tweeted, no lives matter until black lives matter. What happened a couple of weeks after she wrote that? Black men barged into her home and she was begging for her life. This is poetic justice. And you know what the greatest irony of all this is? A group of black men raided her home and held her at a knife point. Similar to how George Floyd's friends raided a pregnant woman's home while he held her at gunpoint. Aimed the gun at her stomach. Molly felt the exact pain that George Floyd's victim felt that day. And I'm not trying to kick her while she's down. I do think she can become a wiser person after this. For example, her Twitter header was a photo of black lives matter. Not being assaulted, she replaced it. Good on her.\n",

I remember catching on because I'm onto the Jew shit. I remember catching on to handsome truth streams when he first started. That's how the importance of it. I saw, wow, this guy is huge. He is attracted to the following. He is a huge, great woman name. I was out in the mouth of domains. There is nobody else who is doing it. That's what I do. I have had the GDL.com HandsomeTruth.com for almost two weeks now. I connected them up to my CMEs social media network because that's the way of the future. That's real open source, unsensorable, non-minute and unimportant. non-monopolistic, it's pure control for us on the internet. Now it's, it's basic, has a lot of work needed to it, but the point is, handsome truth, he didn't want to hear it, he didn't want to talk about it. He didn't even mention it, you know, hey, you got my domain, there was no discussion about it, whatsoever, so just so you know, if you go to the Goi-im defense league, or handsometruth.com, those are mine, I own them, I operate them, not the Goi-im defense league, not handsome truth, anybody else. I'm not gonna do anything with them, except for continuing doing what I have been doing, using them on my CME social media network. I just want people to know, that they're mine, not the GDL's, not handsome truths. And why has there been no concern to use them at all? There was talk of this atom from no more news, well I'm very suspicious about, suspicious about Lely. You found the GDL.org. I want to start raising money, because this fucking expensive, to have websites, no it's not. Websites, a domain costs $15 a year. I pay $25 a month for my reseller hosting package. I'm hosting almost 30 domains myself, $25 a month, $15 a year. Don't buy into their lies, man. Man, I had high hopes for the GDL. I'm really pissed off. This is gonna come out like a shitty video, you know, but I don't care, I'm fucking pissed. It's just fucking, you got great tools that you're disposal and you don't have any desire to use them whatsoever, you go fucking, you know what, everybody's on the discord. Everybody, I did a search the other day, because I couldn't remember the voice chat we used to use, when I used to play games. And I did a search for audio chat programs. You know what came up top of the fucking list? Discord, I'd never even heard of it before. Now everyone of these fucking juthers channels, they're promoting Discord too. Oh, get on my discord. All of a sudden, Discord wrangling everybody up. I would be very fucking suspicious about Discord. That's why I refuse to join it. I don't need it. I got my own chat programs. I have my own social media network. I created it, I run it. You can own your own too and you can run it. You know exactly what's being done on it and who's doing it? And nobody can shut it down unless they shut down the whole fucking internet. Discord, taking out like that Facebook, bam, like that Twitter, bam, like that. One DDS attack, the whole thing goes down. It's not gonna happen with the senior social network. Better be careful, man. It pipe, pipe is everywhere. You know what? They use to trick a magician, a master magician. Takes a master magician to fool a magician. Just remember that. You're dealing with some smart motherfuckers. They've been doing this for hundreds of years. People that just woke up a couple weeks ago or a month ago, a couple years ago. Fuck these guys have been practicing for hundreds of years.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_422.mp3:  We are here tonight as the League of the South to put three items to the flame into the ovens of justice. One is this insidious star of rim fan the symbol of the Jew. The second is the Communist Manifesto written by Jude Karl Marx, which was responsible for the deaths of over a hundred million people in the 20th century and the Talmud, the blueprint for international jewelry's plan to rent the world at the white race. All of these will be consigned to the flames of justice tonight. A hundred and nine times in the history of the world that you have been banished from our bids. Lord, we ask that you make number 110 come soon for our Southland. And we also, Father, ask you to reveal to the world that hopes that the Jew has been perpetrating now for 80 years. Something called a Holocaust, which is nothing but a con game. Based on all three of these symbols. We can sign these to the holy fire of these ovens for the Gentiles of the world. We stand for the white race against all of our enemies, particularly the Jew and all of these symbols represent that enemy. And we can sign them to these flames tonight. My God, my gift so.\n",

I mean, I think when stuff like Mel Gibson when he said you know like Jewish stuff or anything like that There's outrage what he says things out there is outrage, but I think secretly There's nobody that likes blatant anti-Semitism Semitism more than Jews because it's something you can point to it's not just a gas in the air anymore You know, but I'm not you know, I'm I'm a Jew in that it Pores out of my point oozes out of my pores uncontrollably and personally I have no religion But I'm Jew-E to be on to my control.

The vice president recently met with Black Faith Leaders in Maryland. I ask him about how the administration is handling social justice reform. First off, we're not going to defund the police. The reality is that more than 99 percent of the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the very best of us, Barbara. And whether it's in Lancaster, across Pennsylvania, across America, the American people know that. Now that doesn't mean that we don't have an opportunity to advance some common sense reforms. The president and I have been meeting with African American community leaders. We'll be continuing to do that. We'll be listening very intently. Look, the death of George Floyd was a national tragedy. It shocked the conscience of the nation. And we're speaking to law enforcement officials about how we can give further guidance on the appropriate use of force, how we can provide additional resources for training law enforcement officers. The vice president says the administration does not plan to stop there, but plans to address long-term historic inequities that he blames on failed liberal policies. He also says unemployment was the lowest ever recorded for African Americans under President Trump. Barbara Bard W. G. A. L. News 8\n",

I would petition Colin Powell to find a way to get us out of Iraq as soon as possible. I have a lot of concerns about the environment and I would petition Vice President Al Gore to start working on that. He seems very passionate about it. I would also look into legalizing narcotics and suspend all this law enforcement hoopla and take that money and use it towards their education. Another problem is health insurance. There are people that cannot afford their prescriptions, they can't afford to go see doctors. Everybody in this country should have health insurance and I would see that they did by the time I was out of office. I think we need a revision in the IRS, I think we need a flat tax and speaking of the IRS. If I were president, one of the more important things for me personally would be to part in my felony tax charge, which I'm sure would raise a few eyebrows.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_568.mp3:  In the halohaq, in Yeridayah, that's the second section of the four sections of halohaq, Kuala'-e-Shuhun, A'ruch, that's that table. In chapter 266, haloha 3, 4, 5, and 6, he describes how the circumcision is to be done. This is after the cutting. The mohoun does what is called the c-7, the c-7 means to suck, and it means doing so with this amount. The one who says, well, why can't you use a tube? Well, you could technically, but it's not the custom as to how it was done. Now, why is it that way? You could say that the old man's didn't have tubes, now he can have tubes, so why not? The answer I thought about it is that it's not as effective because the tube does not seal as well. It's not as pliable, and furthermore, it's not as quick and it's not as close. You have to have a quick suction action, you have to have more pliability. Also, there's a theory, some people feel that it is, some people feel that it's not that the saliva of a human big has some antiseptic qualities. It's actually brought in the halal of the Talmud that the saliva of certain people were actually used as curatives. So saliva is not a bad thing. saliva has elements of cleaning antiseptic elements within it. And the other part of it is that the suction process of the amount is quicker, more pliable, and it's more exact and works much better. Now, this of course is technical. So I thought, is there another element to the idea of Mitzi Psepepep that I might be able to communicate with you? And this is not authoritative. So relax if I'm wrong. Fine, then I'm wrong.\n",

I remember when it all started. My buddy Dylan joking about Bible studies. This bull cut hair due bagged was pretty funny, but his thoughts were kind of muddy. They were twisted, but in a good way, like me, think of blasting the blacks. I can still hear him laughing now, me saying well, people asking how he could do it, put 9 people, under, put him to slumber, take them to God, while I say what God. Because my boy, the Charleston chimp choking champion had the right thing in mind to attack the church, from the inside, and corrupt the minds of the fucking bagged niggers in that church, so what I have to say is, take me to church. I have to confess my sins. I have to search for something to let me and the number 9 is coming to my mind. 9 people, 9 niggers, 9 Christians. Let's take a vacation in South Carolina and finally.

So, so long, next time you think you are safe when you're in church, just remember Dylan, and me, and I'm free, as you seek so and a key to a better life, shoot up your wife, and kill your kids, kill the niggers at a church.

They gave me a fucking bulletproof vest, so I ran. I stole a car and killed a couple niggers on the way. Shit man, ready for this? Take me to church.

Look, God, I even talked about this. It's sad. It breaks my heart, really. Look, you bastard. I don't care. You didn't do what you were supposed to do. 26 years later, Hillary saw this charge as so damaging she called the press to her new house in New York to deny it. She said Paul Frey had defamed her before and had written to ask her forgiveness. It did not happen. I've never said anything like that in my entire life. It's absolutely false. And I am just tired of this kind of politics. Why aren't you angry? I am really angry. I am very angry. Thanks to Thron, a window got broken. Who broke the window I couldn't tell you?

And of course, you know, they get this niggas in and the next thing you know is they are... they commit crime and in this case, this motherfucker will stop by police and of course, Neutrus says, starts punching, kicking the Scottish police officers, Scotland yard in this case. And another nigger that was nearby kept yelling, don't put your fucking knee in his neck. Don't put your fucking knee in his neck. You know, say this thing about niggers, man. They know how to come together. They know how to stick together. They're like while those wild pack of animals, you know, like chimps and gorillas, whether they are right or wrong, they come together and defend each other. I wish white people would learn from this animals, this simple rule to come together and defend each other, rather than, you know, fight each other many times. White people should not be fighting each other. You don't learn much from niggers, but this is probably the only thing you can learn from niggers. Defend each other, form a pack and fight together against this animals. So in this case, of course, you know, the stupid nigger, you know, pulled out George Floyd bullshit, you know. I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe. If you can't breathe, you motherfucker, you won't be shouting at the top of your lung. They cannot even be goose fonees, you know, like bath fonees.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_346.mp3:  Over the years I made several videos regarding so-called astronaut Don Pettit. Basically the head of mockery when it comes to NASA. I find it very interesting what he says during this interview from a few months back. He basically states that technology to go back to the moon has been destroyed. He'd love to go back in an nanosecond, but that technology does not exist anymore. But then he goes on to talk about going to Mars. First off before even showing this video clip with him speaking about again this technology which I find very bizarre saying it's been destroyed. How was it destroyed? He doesn't go into details how this so-called technology that they used to go to the moon years ago has been destroyed. Let's take a look first off again when it comes to mockery in this video clip. Basically again mocking his audience, his followers during this presentation. Take a listen to what he says here. Astronauts are really really good at making pictures in space. It looked like you've never left a planet. In fact it's almost hard press to tell whether you're in space or not in this picture. You know we've got some fancy backdrops I guess. What a strange person this is. You know basically again if you follow my channel and see my previous videos on this so-called astronaut Don Pettit. Of course none of these men have been in this space. There's nothing more than basically actors playing a role on the world stage making the masses, the millions upon millions of people throughout the world believe they've been in space when they've never been in space at all. Now I'm going to put the video clip itself with Don Pettit again being interviewed just very bizarre interview. Not going into details how this so-called technology to go to the moon has been destroyed and at the very end I'll put out something very interesting what he says. People need to read between the lines. Take a listen. I'd go to the moon in a nanosecond. The problem is we don't have the technology to do that anymore. We used to but we destroyed that technology and it's a painful process to build it back again. But going to Mars should be one of the next series of steps that humans do. The first step should be going back to the moon for a number of technical reasons and exploration reasons and then after that Mars maybe a high orbit in Venus atmosphere maybe going to Europa. There's all kinds of targets to go to places of interest in our solar system. The only limit to human future is in our own imaginations. With that goofy look on his face he says the only limit to human future is our own imagination. So I find it very interesting. He's not saying it's based on technology what's feasible based off technology. He says it's based on our imaginations. So it comes down to it like I played this video clip I'll show in a second with William Shatton or stating science and science fiction are one of the standards. No difference whatsoever. Take a listen. My question is through your career and your writing and your acting you've inspired so many people to enter the sciences. How do you balance science with science fiction? They're both the same. The mystery of science fiction is what I'm talking about. Science and science fiction are essentially the same. Thank you very much. How do you improve the black hole? How do you know those gravitational waves prove the collision of two from my holes? Somehow eventually they are able to observe phenomena. No that ain't absurd. It's too far away. It's too theoretical. How do we know what they're saying is true? You know what reading is? It's all science fiction. About science and science fiction are essentially the same. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_352.mp3:  Consversial ads with shocking messages are set to debut in San Francisco. Like the one that says, quote, killing Jews is worship that draws us close to Allah. Just let that statement sink in for a moment. And then here's another one. Homosexuality is ugly. In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country, but of course a picture of Iran's president, Makmuna Medinajad. The ads are being posted on buses around San Francisco. Ten of them have gone up. The woman is behind them, Pamela Geller and her group, American Freedom Defense Initiative and Pamela, thank you for being here with us this morning. A lot of controversy about these ads. Tell us why you want them up. What is the point? Well, these ads are a response to a deceptive and fallacious ad campaign being run by the Muslim Brotherhood Group care that says that Gihad is getting to the gym every day. And so our ads were designed to show the reality of Gihad using actual quotes from high-profile Muslim Prime Minister of Turkey, the Fort Hood Gihadi, the Times Square bomber, to increase awareness about the ideology that sanctions the violence and supremacism of Gihad. It being accused of this being just blatantly anti-Muslim, though. What is your reaction to that criticism? Well, it's deeply offensive to Muslims because the implication is that all Muslim support Gihad, and we know that that's not true. We don't have to pat on the back every Muslim that doesn't want to kill us, we expect that. That's our bar. So I think that that's a canard. I think it's a deceptive statement. I know from my own email box that many Muslims stand with us because they escaped Gihadi Wars, and they escaped the Sharia. But there have been over 20,000 deadly Islamic attacks since 9-11, and Americans need to understand the ideology that inspires these acts of war. All right, Pamela, I want to bring in Linda Sarsor. She's with the National Network of Arab-American Communities. Linda, you've seen these ads. Pamela says she's quoting Muslims, including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinajad. What's your reaction? The ads are absurd. They're offensive. You're quoting a man who is a holocaust denier. I mean, this is not an American Muslim. And Miss Geller has a history and track record of vilifying the Muslim American community and pinning communities up against each other, including her most recent homophobic ads, which are very offensive, not only to the Muslim American community, but also to the LGBT community here in the United States. This is not the first time that ads have gone up. You remember the controversy over similar ads in New York, Pamela, your organization successfully sued the New York City Transad agency when it tried to ban those ads, the issue, you know, for First Amendment freedom of speech. So San Francisco's Transit Authority is in the same boat. Listen. So this is, again, what we see, ad hominem attacks, libels and defamation against me. They don't condemn the statements in the ads. You have Mr. Turkey saying the mosques are our fortresses, the minarets are our bayonets, and the Muslims are our soldiers. And the quotes that I'm using are actual quotes from the leader of the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt, Sheikh Karadari calling for the death penalty for homosexuals. My calling attention to this makes me homophobic. No, I, not calling attention to the plight of gaze under the sharia is killing people. And so, of course, attack me, but don't, but where is the condemnation of the actual statements that these high-profile Muslims are making? We don't hear that at all. I think it's very interesting, and it speaks volumes as to the motive behind, there's been mischief and stories. I will say there's been plenty of condemnation of Bakmoud Ahmadinajad and for statements that he has said about homosexuals and homosexuality. I mean, there's been plenty of statement, kind of, nation of him and others. I mean, there's been prosecution of some of the people that you show on these, you know, the Times Square bomber and the like. So, it's not as if, I guess I don't understand your point. My point is the American people are being disarmed by obscuring the true reality of Jihad. And this is our way of sort of leapfrogging over the media who whitewashes and sanitizes it and, you know, alerting the American people to what is the greatest national security threat that on-nation faces. Linda, can you see how the courts view this as a freedom of speech that it is Pamela's right to put up these billboards? I'm not debating her, right? And her freedom of speech, and that's why we live in the United States of America. But I will say on the, particularly on the homophobic remarks, we could take these ads and it could be about any of the Abrahamic faiths which have similar, if not identical, views on homosexuality. But what I'm troubled by is miscalers obsession and fascination with Islam and with American Muslims. Why is it that none of those remarks are by American Muslims? We have plenty of national organizations, dominant Muslim Americans in this country, who have not publicly stated any anti-gay as a matter of fact, the LGBTQ community is one of our largest allies because both of our communities, both American Muslims and LGBTQs are marginalized and ostracized. And I'm a civil rights activist. I believe that we live in the United States of America and everyone deserves the same rights that I have. And I will never take the rights away from someone if I'm in this country fighting for the rights of my community. So I'm just really troubled and I want to question the obsession with Islam and American Muslims. I have to leave it there. Well, I would like to say Christians and Jews are not killing gay people. So there may be quotes in the Bible, but they're not killing gay people. And my obsession is with life. And my obsession is with 9.11 and with Times Square and the attempted bombing of the Federal Reserve Building and the repeated thwarted attacks that you had. My obsession is with life and that's why what I'm fighting for, freedom and liberty. All right, we believe it there. And individual rights for all. Pamela Geller and Linda Sarsor, thank you both for spending a little bit of time to explain it to us. And that religion is a lie wrapped with some facts and truths. I want the truth. You can't handle the truth. Our channel is now proudly sponsored by JK Shindland, who is the author of the highly controversial book The People vs. Muhammad.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_353.mp3:  A moment, but I want to take you live now to listen to some of those black pastors who met with Donald Trump today, Donald Trump speaking live here in New York. Let's listen in. To be direct, but to have compassion as well, concerning the issue of the racial slurs and the racial comments that he has made. It was addressed head on. It was addressed head on and we are walking away with the feeling that perhaps after more conversation, we will be able to echo the tone at the top as voice to those that are lacking a voice. Thank you. We had a very productive, constructive meeting. We made history today because we had meaningful dialogue with Mr. Donald Trump. And we voiced concerns that were sensitive to the African American community. We asked questions and the questions were answered where we are all satisfied with the answers and we're unified front right here with a wonderful time, wonderful dialogue, wonderful fellowship, wonderful interaction. It was a great day. Mr. Scott, what were your concerns? I didn't have concerns because I was already convinced, but there were concerns that the liberal media has put out portraying Mr. Trump in a light that I know he's not the type of person that he was depicted to be. What we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him. And they find out that he's not the person that the media has depicted him to be. I support Donald Trump and everybody knows everybody knows that. Yes. Dr. Darrell Scott, new spirit, revival center, Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Why is the minister not what endorsed today? That was the confusing part. Some ministers were meeting him today for the first time. They went to hear his voice. They're going to pray to God about it as ministers do, but nobody had nobody in this meeting came out with a negative reaction in any kind of way. Everybody came out positive as a great atmosphere, great spirit in the room. And everybody in that room lights Donald Trump. What do you say to everybody magazine that had that letter condemning pastures like you 150 religious leaders signed that letter? The magazine needs to do some responsible journalism. They should have called me first. Mr. Scott, can we get a reaction from you on the meeting? Mr. Scott, can we get a reaction from you on the meeting and how well it was? I thought it was an amazing meeting. I thought that I met some fantastic people, some of whom I've known. I thought it was an absolutely amazing. You know, it lasted for two and a half hours. We came up with lots of good ideas and lots of future ideas, but I thought it was an amazing meeting. And how did you address some of the concerns that were raised? Well, I think we'll be addressing them over the coming months and even over the coming months. I mean, these are deep-seated difficulties that certain communities have and we're going to address them. And if certainly I'm put in a position where I can do something about them, which in this case happens to be president, we will be working very, very closely with everybody. And we're going to be solving a lot of problems. Right now you have black youth that you look at African American youth where it's 51 and 55 and 57 percent unemployed. You have African American people of different ages where it's double and triple other numbers. So we're looking at a lot of different things, but this meeting was amazing, amazing people. We've almost had close to 100 people in the room and I just want to thank you. I want to thank both of you. And in particular, I'll tell you what, it's been the whole group of people standing behind me. You can't see him because we actually didn't think we were going to be having a press conference, but we all thought it was such a good meeting. We would do that and we have many, many endorsements that came out of the meeting. Black Lives Matter Real Movement is Black Lives Matter. Well, I want to discuss that because you know, I felt it and I felt it. Black Lives are very important. White Lives are very important. And to me, all lives are very important. Very, very important. What is your reality that some of the Black Lives Matter that are really going to be there's a problem? Well, I don't think we have backlash. I mean, I saw a love in that room. I see love everywhere I go. I see tremendous amounts like right now I'm getting on a plane. I'm going to Georgia. We're going to have a tremendous crowd in Georgia just like we did in Sarasota. We had 12,000 people on an all-time record by double. And we're going to have a tremendous crowd. I'm literally leaving right now. In fact, because the meeting went so much longer and it went longer only because of the love. It didn't go longer for other reasons. There were unbelievable solutions, I think, to problems that we will solve that other people won't be able to solve. What would the first concerns that were raised today? Well, I look, the concerns are you look at unemployment. You look at African American Katie. Look at African youth. I mean, you have 51 percent unemployment. There's tremendous concerns and they have a right to be concerned. Well, you know, the tone has taken me to first position in every single poll, including state and including national polls. The beautiful thing about the meeting is they really didn't ask me to change the tone. I think they want to see victory because ultimately it is about we want to win and we want to win together. And I will not forget the group of people that I've met with 100 people. I will not forget these people. I want to tell you they are really, really smart, sharp, amazing people who love their community, who love the country and love their community. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. Mr. Trump said that Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9-11. Today he said that never happened that he should stop talking about this. Well, you know, he didn't say that the other day. He was very weak the other day. So the other day he said it like, well, he doesn't know. And now I guess he feels a little bit emboldened. He must be careful with what he says. What about your surface? What do you think that would be? Well, we'll see what surface. HECS dug into our archives. Let's see what surface. You'll see. I can tell you this. I've had hundreds and hundreds of calls and fleets of people that saw it and plenty of people saw it. That's true. Is that today that you are not going to be the Republican nominee? Can you react to that? Well, he's got to say that. I mean, he expects to be. But I think that I will be leading in every poll and leading by actually very white margin. So I think I will.

Oh, I think I'm going to win in Iowa and I think we're going to win in New Hampshire. And I think we're going to win just about everywhere we go. And every poll is indicating that. And having the help of all of you folks, I tell you what's been really known and I appreciate it. I appreciate it so much. Thank you very much. We had a wonderful time in the meeting. We made a lot of progress. It's not the last one. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump. Have you made a commitment to give a financial contribution to any of these shirts? No, I have a new zero. No, it's not about that. Zero such an important question. Zero. Have you personally been surprised during this campaign to hear some people say that you're rhetoric that they find it racist? No, but that's the way they say they say it about everybody. That's a very commonly used term. And you think that is not what's going to matter. And I have many endorsements to. Perhaps you can speak to that. I've had many endorsements today. How many were where over 100 over 100 passes right here. Over 100. Some some committed. I don't know the number. Some are. And the rest are praying about it. They said we have to go pray about it. And then they'll come back and endorse it a future time. It's a very successful meeting. Most very successful. The next few months are crucial for the primary. You're ready to go. You still have the energy? I have a lot of energy. Do I have energy? I'm leaving right now for Georgia. Bye everybody. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Love me. Thank you.\n",

I've spent a lot of, most of my energy for the last two years working very hard in electoral politics for and with DSA candidates. Both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Tiffi Cumbon. And I feel passionately that that was great work and that the national endorsement helped. I am still against this resolution because I do not think that this is the way to best strengthen either our electoral work or our organization. There are only so many times we can go back to the well for our members for our things. And when we do that, it should be for DSAs funding all these projects that we've been passing now and our educational programs. What we, DSA should be offering is to national things, is our volunteer time, our connections, and our energy. We can help financially when we send out a notice that DSA has endorsed Tiffany Cumbon. She's fabulous for these reasons. We urge you to give money. And people won't feel like it's an appeal to DSA. Then it becomes a separate little thing to give to this exciting candidate.

But I join, thinking black dead out in my blood, and the end of a lacé-peak, can't keep you away from a little nigger, hating me. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the blackest of them all? A man named King, it ain't no doubt, and it's causing lots of trouble with his bad boom, mouth, or...

It's enough to make a man throw up, sure it's hard to figure, how any nigger could ever fuck a freezing nigger. She treated her just like a queen, gave him all my money, it looks like jokes on me, but I don't think it's funny. At pussy ain't worth paying for, as far as I can figure, there's nothing quite as worthless as a white girl with the nigger, And the thing I did to push it, but I'd dig like dick it'd been, and kiss the lips, suck them off, time and time again. It's enough to make a man throw up, sure it's hard to figure, how any nigger could ever fuck a goddamn nigger. So for all you nigger, loving heart this song is just for you.\n",

Then at night I'd kick back and count my dimes in peace. The only time one of my niggers would seize who work is if they died or were caught by the police. My house would be the whitest like my skin's the lightest I'd make sure they never got a chance in the slightest to ever obtain rights or escape to the North. Their uses my nigs' slave would be their only word. But they wish I would lash him and then I'd stash him in the cellar. Then the day later I would cash him back in for bank.

It helped me relax and relive the glory days when the nigger misbehaved. They were set ablazed and no one gave a shit cause niggers weren't human. and pave the way for a part-time to be destroyed, and leave a point where the segregation I enjoyed used to be.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_637.mp3:  Arno McAllis knows better than most, the mind of a far right-wing white supremacist. He says he was one. I had been violent since I was a little kid and hate was just like another part of the rush. And that's who I was when I heard white power skinhead music that told me the reason I was violent and the reason I was hateful was because I was a white warrior. In the late 80s, McAllis was a founding member of what became the largest racist skinhead organization in the world. He was also the lead singer of a white power metal band. McAllis left his life of hate behind in 1994 after becoming a single parent. A second friend of mine was shot and killed in a street fight after a concert my band had played and by that point I had lost count of how many friends had went to prison. So it finally hit me that if I didn't change my ways, death or incarceration was going to take me from my daughter. But his past would soon come back to haunt him. In 2012, a white supremacist, someone who had joined the gang that McAllis formed, went to this seek temple on the outskirts of Milwaukee and shot seven people dead. As I'm going to the temple that morning, we started to get notifications that there was white supremacist inside the temple and at that time I knew that both my parents were inside. My deep kalechus father and the president of the temple, Satwant Singh kalechus, was among those that died. Six weeks after the attack, kalechus contacted McAllis, looking for answers. The meeting proved to be fruitful. The pair realized they could work together to help find solutions to hate. They decided to form Surf to unite, a group that works to divert young people away from violent extremist ideologies. The habit of white supremacy is not going to be easy for us to change. And it's going to take these tectonic plates to really shift and move. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center's annual year in HATE and Extremism report, the number of hate groups has increased by 55 percent since 2017. Going by the definition that hate is a willful denial of compassion, the answer to hate, I believe, is compassion.\n",

If you're upset that the Utah legislature and the City of Salt Lake invited this organization to come and trample on your rights please go right now to United Nations Utah.com and sign the petition and then share this video on all of your social media Don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more bombshell reports about the United Nations in Utah and what you can do to take back your local government and to make sure that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal and that you're not going to be a criminal\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_409.mp3:  and they're and and they continue to fucking do this shit from YouTube. I say, well, fuck you. I'm gonna I'm gonna retaliate against you. I'll escalate this fucking conflict until you don't want to fuck with me anymore. And yeah, I contacted alt. I said, you want to go fucking fuck some assholes over and rather than take the information from me, he published my email to Twitter and then immediately after that, angry white man published something that was the result of a month's long and fucking investigation and they lost some shit and I'm fucking glad because they suck and they don't deserve a platform. Now let me let me ask you a couple things. Now first off, hold, you didn't preface your email with, you know, look, it's Jared Hold. I'm not gonna say he necessary. What are respected that anyway, but excuse me, by the way, you didn't say, you know, off the, can we talk off the record or this and that. So I guess by the official journalistic code, he's he's can actually share that, you know what I mean? Did you think about doing that or I don't give a fuck like the thing is that if I had given him the information, I'd have told everybody that I gave him the information. This was not something that I was trying to do serotoniously, right? So like every time that I've talked to the federal government, every time I've talked to the media, I tell everybody exactly what I've done, right? So like, you know, my whole fucking, the reason that people have all this fucking, you know, if people take things out of fucking context, but like the reason people have so much out of context shit to say about me is because I feel obligated to like inform people of what I'm doing when I when I engage in these things, okay? And so I didn't, you know, I hadn't given hold to any information. So I didn't feel like I needed to say anything yet. But like if I had done this, I'd have taken credit for it. I'd be like, yeah, I got you de platform. Do not fuck with me, asshole. That's exactly what I would have said. So like I didn't really care. It was suboptimal that he published it the way he did. You know, I would have preferred things to go differently, but you know, it's not like I think that the fucking left wing media is going to adhere to a fucking standard of decency anyway. They're bunch of lying to pricks. Now let me ask you, can you see why some people might see this and like be upset with with what you did here? I would expect them to be upset. I'm trying to fuck them over. That's the whole entire point. Now, but I mean, just other people's well, like, I mean, you're it's kind of funny the way you put it out. I'll read it again. I've got some, uh, internet scene conflicts, which would best be solved by my competitors getting de platform that, uh, I laugh when I read it because it's just flat out, take them off the air. That's exactly what I'm trying to do, right? So like they use, look, these guys are on YouTube. They're violating the terms of service, right? And so like they, and like they had me on, they had me on Goi talk to go and respond to these defamation that they were giving fucking voice to, right? But the thing is it, since they're violating the terms of service, what they do is they delete the streams afterwards. There's not an archive. They take their super chats and they take the fucking money and run, right? So they have me on to respond to the defamation, but then the next day, they're out there airing the defamation again. Well, I'm not going to go on your fucking channel every day and respond to this every time, obviously, right? So like something has to be done in order to stop these fucking assholes from defaming my character. Okay, that's a league. If in the F-no state, fucking character defamation is legally actionable. Okay? And so the fucking, so since I can't punch these fucking faggots in their faces, I find other ways to fucking make their lives difficult. And if I can fucking feed them to the Jews, then I will.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_353.mp3:  Okay, this is the kind of crime that you're not going to hear about on the 6 o'clock news, news or the National News or the Front Page of A News paper. There's a black male by the name of Javan Hatchett who went on to stab nearly to death. The guy is lucky to be alive. I'm also a zone worker because the black felt the need to find a white male to kill. Now he's accused of beating his white cellmate to death over the weekend. So they put him in the same jail with a white cellmate and then he goes on, of course, to beat because his racism doesn't stop once he's in prison. So the lawyers are saying, why did you put this racist black male in the same prison as with another white male? You're not going to put a rapist according to the lawyer. You're not going to put a racist, a rapist in the same prison cell with a woman. Okay, so this is the kind of news that's happening more and more, blacks committing racial crime. This one that made the list here is really quite red because they normally don't talk about it. And it's time for white people and black people to live separate lives really. I mean, it should be segregation. Whites should not be allowed anywhere near blacks and the other way around blacks, especially should not be allowed near white people. They should not go to white businesses because you know there's going to be violence every time you see this violent outbursts in restaurants, McDonald's, liquor stores, bodegas. It's always black males attacking whites, attacking the owners, attacking the clerks. And I mean, I cannot believe that this country, the white people in this, I actually tolerating this. The media obviously has a lot to do with it because they don't like to report on this. But this is what's happening. This guy goes on to kill white people because they're white male because why? Because he saw some video of cops restraining black criminals. You know, he just goes to show you that we cannot live with blacks. It's just impossible. And the media is not making it easier by basically squashing the news and reporting on it, ignoring it, finding excuses for it. They find excuses for this black criminal all the time. It's gotta stop.\n",

Well, there's no good reason for the US to be in Syria if you are only considering American interests and that's only a tiny fraction of what is important these days.

Trump is a puppet of Israeli interests doing whatever she'll then add Olsen and B's look at Nick's tell him to do. John Bolton and Jared Kushner are right there by Trump's side to ensure there is not even a slight derivation from the plan.

My, whatever tiny pathetic future I have is going to be totally colossal. You can make a case that America has become, has been great because every, every, I think John Adams said this would be getting right. Basically if you're in a free society, a capitalist society, after two, three, four generations of hard work, everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled, whatever.

Now you take a nigger, he ain't nobody's food, he doesn't buy any gasoline to drive his kids to school. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. Our government has gone crazy, I'd change things if I could. If I was only a nigger, I could afford to live in a white neighborhood. All the things that I could do, if I was black and hell bent, I could send my kids to college, and he wouldn't cost me one damn cent. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. The wife and I were down on our look. We were really getting up tight, they said at the welfare office, you ain't black your white. Oh, how I've tried to get a job, or diploma I had with pride, the post office man laughed and said, you're not dark enough to even qualify. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. I took a civil service exam and passed it without shame. A nigger took one next to me, and he couldn't even ride his own name. The nigger he got to job, now he's got him a top brass, he couldn't qualify for a trash truck. I'm out on the street on my ass. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was a Jesse Jackson, I'd be nobody's slob, wearing $500 suits that nigger hasn't even got a job. If I was Jackson Brown, I could set back and relax, and if elected president could paint the white house black, damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was a jigger boot, I could find me my roots, with an Afro big as a watermelon, and a pair of white disco boots. If I was only dark, I could stand tall in this life, I could eat how off the hall, just me and my white wife. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. Things are supposed to be segregated, but things are a little off key. I've never seen a white man, head of the NAACP. It ain't that I don't like a nigger. If I've rubbed you wrong by chance, take a look at that missile tow, hanging on the seat of my pants. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was a kinky top, I could be a Martin Luther King. I'd have me a vision on a mountain top, my song the whole world would sing. I could have me a peace march on the streets of Memphis, Tennessee. I could tear up the whole damn city, and the police wouldn't dare stop me. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. A lot of things in life I know, but one thing I can't figure, why a nigger can call me a hunky, and I can't call a nigger a nigger. If I was a jungle bunny, I could ring a golden bell, I could be a Muhammad Ali, and be loved by hard cozeo. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was a you bangy seven foot tall and lean, I could be a famous player on a Washington basketball team. If I was only chocolate brown, I could have me some turn of greens, up off some fat and watermelon, chitlins, and a pot of butter beans. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. Now a Martin Luther King was buried in Washington with class, faced down in his box, so the politicians could kiss his ass. I guess it's just politics, and he sure gets my golden. Kiss assing with a nigger just to get his vote. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was only a burrhead, I'd live high on a hill, selling cocaine in prostitutes, and popping all kinds of pills. Now take the NAACP, they can march and raise all kinds of hell, let the KKK start to move, and they'll all wind up in jail. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. I dreamed my life was over. I heard Saint Peter say, today we're taking only niggers, you've got to go the other way. Then I heard the devil.

I'm going back to the heels of Arkansas, where they don't have those knocked down one side in nigger piece marches, protesters, welfare checkrabbers.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_227.mp3:  Well, here we go again. First, I remember a long time ago it feels like now when we were still talking about, you know, lockdowns and all that. I first covered the case of a mod Arbery who was a black supposed jogger, you know, just doing for a jog in the neighborhood that was a gun downed by some virulent clansmen. Or so the official narrative went in the time and it was funny how that whole thing unfolded. And then we got the George Floyd thing which, you know, unlike the Amod Arbery thing, had a pretty universal agreement of people saying, you know, hey, what? He was using a $20 counterfeit bill. He might not have even known it was counterfeit. And then he ends up dead. Neon is next for three minutes after he's passed out, you know, everybody pretty much agreed at the time that, hey, bad situation. Then we get all these riots and things and then, you know, the media is telling us that, oh, well, the riots aren't a part of the peaceful protest yet to separate them, which, you know, was nonsense. They would never do that for any right-wing group. If there was any violence, there was one person, you know, who even said a mean word at a journalist. The whole protest would be condemned as violent by the press. But here we have rioters, you know, not only shouting mean things at CNN, but actually beating up CNN employees and even going to CNN headquarters in Atlanta and trying to burn it down before being, you know, stopped by the police. And then eventually it felt like this week, or in last week, it felt like, you don't think we're starting to calm down. That there wasn't as much violence going on and that there was just more, it was more of the aftermath. People still talking about, you know, how cops are bad and stuff. And, oh, and then we had the chas, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, wasn't that fun. And so I felt like we were moving on. And then all of a sudden, on Friday night, all hell breaks loose when an Atlantic cop kills some black-eyed Wendy's. And apparently this was some guy who was drunk going through the drive-through and passed out while he was waiting for his food. And so the, you know, the Wendy's called the cops to wake him up and get him out of there. And of course they made him, you know, they had him take a breathalyzer, which from what I understand, the smart thing to do is if a cop offers you a breathalyzer, you want to turn it down and just go to the station, get arrested, which sounds counter-intuitive. But that's what I've heard is like the better legal thing to do. Because maybe then they do a full toxicology report and there's like margin, there's a margin of error. There's more error when it comes to the breathalyzer, I think. So if you're on the edge, you know, it might register you as overly-delimit when you're not. But this guy apparently had a, was like 10 times the legal limit. So he was not really on the margin. So probably wouldn't have helped him just to decide to get arrested and not take the breathalyzer. But either way, it was very clear. His goal was to not get arrested. Because once he took the breathalyzer and it was clear that he was, you know, heavily intoxicated, although, I mean, he seemed, he seemed not probably not okay to drive, but he wasn't, you know, he wasn't falling all over himself drunk when he was talking on the body cam footage. But we know when it ended up happening was the cops decided, okay, you're drunk. So we have to arrest you for DUI because you were in the driver's seat of your car. You were driving through the Wendy's drive-through. So you're getting a DUI and a guy resisted and grabbed the taser and ran off. And that's when things become a little murky because we don't have the best video, at least that I haven't seen yet. We have one video where they run off screen and you can't see them and then you hear the gunshots. And then there's another one which captures the full scene from the Wendy's surveillance. And in that one, I mean, it looks to me, actually, in the other, in the first video, it looked to me like the cop at first did not pull out his gun. He pulled out, you know, his own taser because I think he, the Richard Brooks was his name, grabbed the taser from the other officer. Because I see the officer chasing Brooks pull out something that looks yellow and you know, it fires what looks like, you know, the darts with the wires attached to it that the police tasers have. The kind that sort of, you know, hook into your skin and then they zap you. Well, my guess is he must have missed Brooks because, you know, Brooks keeps running and then he turns around and points the taser at the cops. At least that's what it looks like. We can't see exactly, but you know, that's what the police are saying and the video seems to confirm at least something like that happened. And then the cop pulls out his gun and shoots him. Now, in ordinary times when there's not a lot of tension over this sort of thing, you know, this probably might generate some, some angst amongst locals. But this wouldn't be a national story. I mean, you have a guy who had a DUI resisting arrest and then, and then stole a taser and tried to, you know, use it on the cops and he got shot and oopsie died at the hospital. But with all this going on, you had to know that, you know, the first response to all this is that, you know, people are going to immediately think that this is totally unjustified in every way. I mean, I'm looking at the video. Do I really think that it was a, you know, a great idea to shoot the guy? Well, you know, it's hard because I think of it from the perspective of an ordinary American. And I know that as an ordinary American who's not a police officer, you know, I would get charged for murder unless I shoot someone who's actively, you know, attacking me. If someone's in retreat and they're running away from me and I shoot them in the back, then I'm going to jail. And now police from, you know, I understand or not train that way because they're trained to, you know, hunt people down. The job of a cop is to arrest, you know, people who are suspected criminals. And so, you know, can I say that, you know, in principle, given what his job description is that he did anything wrong? No, I just think that he did something that was, you know, very dumb in our current context. I mean, if I were a cop right now, I would not be, you know, I would look at every time I pull out my gun that I'm sticking my neck out there. And that I am, you know, the one under threat, unless I'm being, you know, directly attacked by somebody. But if you're a cop and you're using your gun in an offensive way, you are going to be in a pretty, you know, pretty bad predicament. You're going to be held to a very high standard. A standard dare I say it almost as high as an ordinary American. So if I were in this guy's position, I'd look at it as, oh, okay, I didn't the Wendy's parking lot had a GUI running away. I'm not going to shoot him because I don't want to put my, you know, put my livelihood at risk. That's the way I would look at it. Now you might say, oh, well, he had the police taser, you know, he's a threat, he's running away, he's drunk, he could go out and hurt somebody. That may be the case, but if I'm in that cop shoes, I'm not taking the risk. My advice to all cops out there is just do everything you can not to shoot. So when I understand it, you know, this guy already fired his taser. And so the tasers are kind of one shot deals. If you miss with the taser there, I believe the training is, you know, you switch to the gun. Because that's your, that's your last resort to try and, you know, subdue a suspect. But if it's a situation like this where it's, you know, something like DUI, which, you know, is a real crime. I don't think that DUI should be legalized or something like that. This isn't, you know, this isn't something as BS as, you know, peddling a counterfeit $20 bill. You know, driving while, you know, 10 times over the legal limit, you know, with alcohol content is dangerous, you know, because you can kill somebody on the road. There's other drivers on the road. I'm not saying that DUI is okay. But when you're under so much scrutiny, I just don't see the point in trying to hunt down every last perp. Cops right now, really, you know, the best thing they can do is the bare minimum that they have to do. The less cops are noticed right now, the better off that they will be. Because in every one of these situations, the mob is going to side with whoever gets killed. Because they're already whipped up into that frenzy of, you know, the police is just killing innocent people. So when the cops kill somebody like this, you know, they're going to give, you know, the suspect, the benefit of the doubt. Much in the same way that, you know, a lot of people would tend to, you know, would tend to believe that suspects who get caught up in, you know, bad times with the police had a coming. The attitude right now with a lot of folks is that, you know, the police are the ones who are always up to no good and they kind of have it coming. So, you know, what did, what sort of riding did we get last night in response to all this? Well, they burned down the Wendy's for no apparent reason. All day, they were not letting people go to the Wendy's. If anyone tried to pull in the parking lot, they were, you know, blocked by the mob, shouted down. And, you know, they hurled, you know, epithets at them telling them, you know, hey, go get a burger or a black owned business. Which, if you're driving down the road and you're just looking for some fast food, I don't know how, you know, which one is owned by a black person or not. I mean, for all I know, that Wendy's could have been owned by a black franchisee. But, the protesters, I guess, since they, they're maybe too afraid to directly attack the police and go burn down the police precinct, like what happened in Minneapolis, they just decided to blame everything on Wendy's because Wendy's happened to be where this guy got killed. And the police, of course, did not protect the Wendy's. The Wendy's was burned to the ground. Now, CNN, I have to give them some credit, was trying to document this. And the rioters, you know, beat up CNN and smash their camera. They do not like CNN. But CNN still called them, you know, protesters and said, well, you know, the protesters didn't like us filming their protest. You know, it's like, oh my god, it's just, it's completely unbearable. Even, you know, I mean, how much more cocked can you be that, you know, when your own guys are getting beat up by these rioters, you still refuse to call them out and call them rioters. You still are carrying water for these people who detest you on the most basic level. They hate you just as much if not more than the average Fox News viewer. And then, in addition to burning down the Wendy's, they decided to shut down I-75, which I'm sure is quite scary, because if you're going through there, and you happen to be, you know, in the line of cars that get stopped, what happens a lot of time is the mob will come up and just start smashing all the cars on the highway. That's their way of protesting is they jump in front of these people, make them stop, and then they smash their cars and graffiti them and things. Now, I haven't seen any evidence of this happening in this case, but, you know, that's my first thought. If I'm one of those cars that get stopped, you're scared to death. The match to be up kids in the car. Because this has happened in other cities when they shut down the highways, they go and just, you know, beat on cars and things. It's frightening. And of course, if you don't have a lot of money and your car gets totaled by a mob, you know, you're kind of screwed. But this isn't how the mob thinks. The mob wants to say that, you know, everybody's responsible for, you know, the actions of individual police officers or whatever. I mean, the comments on Twitter, of course, are absolutely disgusting when you see this kind of violence. People are going, it's like, well, are you saying that a Wendy's is more valuable than black lives? It's like, shut up. I did, you know, I have no patience left for these people. As Hans Hoppe said, crush the anti-fascist mob. That's how I feel the more I look at this stuff. At first, you know, because remember, I'm one of these people who's, you know, rather critical of the police state and, you know, government tyranny and all these things. But, you know, these people are deranged. And don't twist that into meaning a racial thing. I've been very clear from the beginning that I think that this is a whole left wing movement. I mean, look, just look at the chats. I mean, do you think that there's going to, that there's too many black people in the chats? But of course, with Atlanta, you're going to get a lot more black people. But, you know, this is not something that has to do with skin color. And neither, frankly, does the policing thing. I've explained, you know, so many times, you know, why I just detest the racialist argument about crime and about policing. And I've explained the statistics, you know, because there is, there's this thing called multivariate analysis. You might not have heard of it. But just because, you know, there is a correlation between two things. Doesn't mean that there's a direct causation. Just because the number of black people killed by cops as percentage of their population is higher than whites, even though the absolute number is still much lower, that does not mean that cops are, you know, just go out and look into kill black people because they're black. There are other variables you have to control for, you know, like poverty. And, you know, whether they live in high crime areas or not. And of course, poverty tends to determine whether or not you live in a high crime area. If you're LeBron James, you're not going to live in a high crime area and you're probably not going to have too many terrible interactions with the police. But, you know, it's just these arguments have been made so many times, time and time again that if you haven't gotten through to people at this point, you're not going to get through to them. They believe what they want to believe. And they're going to blame who they want to blame. And, you know, they're not even just blaming the police. They're blaming all white people. And demanding that I and other people who don't have enough melanin in our skin bow down to those who do have enough melanin. Now, I don't know exactly where the line is. You know, you look at guys like Barack Obama. He's pretty pale for a supposedly black man. You know, what's the rule? Is having one black grandparent maybe make you a black person, we could use the same rules the Nazis used for the Jews. Or we're going to use the one drop rule from the old South to where if you had one drop a black blood, both in your black person. You know, the racial theorists on the left, I don't think have thought this out so much. Now, I guess a lot of the right wing racists have and they probably have their own rules, but, you know, I don't read them because they're not relevant. Despite what the writers might tell us and what their apologists on Twitter might say, you know, these phantom white supremacists just aren't anywhere. I've never met any of them. Right wing racism is about the most, you know, the most marginalized idea in America. Left wing racism, on the other hand, is exalted and in fact those who do not endorse left wing racism and practice it openly are condemned themselves as evil racists. It's quite ironic. So I suspect that the killing of this ReShard Brooks character is going to reinbigorate things. And, you know, I do feel bad for him and his family. I don't think that he should have died. I mean, obviously the man was intoxicated, so he wasn't, you know, making the best decisions. He was very drunk. And, you know, I would like to think that there was a way that, you know, they could have gone about things that did not result in his death. But either way at this point, you know, there's much bigger issues on the table than just his death. It's, you know, the cohesion and the collapse of our society. So with that said, if you can't do anything about you out of this video, I'd appreciate you clicking that like button and sharing this video. And if you haven't already, please do subscribe because I do upload every day and I'd hate to have you miss one. So I'll see folks back here tomorrow.\n",

Our organization focuses on monitoring and combating anti-semitism and the incitement of terror on social media. In the last three years, we've removed more than 45,000 hateful videos, accounts, pages and content from YouTube and Facebook. You need to understand how crucial our work is. Under the internet, anti-semitism was contained, limited to certain hateful circles. Today, billions of people will, while surfing online, have access to some kind of anti-semitic propaganda. Can you imagine the consequences for tomorrow? As we fight anti-semitism and the incitement of terrorism, we are actually saving lives every day. But we need you to support us in this fight. Go ahead and click that donate button and become part of this important cause. Together, we can fight anti-semitism and terrorism on social media and make a real difference.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_186.mp3:  What's good in the hood? Knocked. Well what I have to say is that the blacks are on a rampage and we need to stop them. The who? The blacks. Those black savages in the streets. BLM. I fucking nuts. BLM, lady. You support those savages? Yeah, they're not savages. They're humans like us. They're not savages. They're just burning down cities and killing people, you know? Not only black people, it is. It's called BLM. Why is it called BLM if it's not about black people? What? It's called... It's not about BLM is how their lives matter. No, it's about privileging the black race so that they can be superior over whites. I don't get how that... No, I... Well they... They... They demand that we pander to them, that we give them special rights, special privileges, that we change the whole legal system so that black people don't go to jail. So it's all about. I disagree. What do you mean you disagree? How? They're saying they want to abolish the police, abolish basically jails. Essentially they just want to get away with crimes, right? It's like, oh, we're going to just be gangbangers and pimps and, you know, if you put us in prison, you're a racist. Yep, so that's all they are. They're just gangbangers and pimps, see you. They want black criminals to get off, yes. Okay. You can believe that, but... So why would you support that as a white woman? Do you think these black men are going to treat you well or something? I don't think every criminal is a black man now. But if specifically if we allow black criminals to get out of prison, do you think that's going to be better for society? I think you're really fucking dramatic and it's funny. Really dramatic. That's what they want. That's what they say that they want. Okay. Did you talk to them? Well, they say abolish the police. Do they not? Did you talk to all of them? Like all black people in the whole world? Well, I see what the BLM movement represents and it represents black supremacy. It represents black power. And... No, I'm not having equal rights. No, that's a fake ruse that they put on to convince doops like you to go along with it, yes. Oh, okay, yeah, I'm a doop. You're a doop. You're a useful idiot for black power. Oh, right. Okay. What used to you? How does it feel to be a useful idiot for black supremacy? Okay. I literally don't give a shit. You don't care. You don't care because all you care about is getting the virtue signaling brownie points, right? Oh, yeah, definitely. Look at me. I'm so... I'm a great person. I love black people. At least I don't hate black people and think that all of them are criminals. Well, not all of them are criminals, just a disproportionate amount of them are. You literally were just saying how they're all criminals. Like, are you okay? At least keep it. Well, I said that the BLM movement are savages as they are. They're burning down cities. See what they did in a connocia? See what they did with them? And it was all strictly only black people, right? Well, what you have is black people and then... Well, you have black people and then white liberal savages, you're also... Oh, I have them on the floor. Let's go. Yeah. You guys support terrorism. You guys support burning, looting and killing. Right. Right, yeah, I forgot. For black power. And you support a lot of bullshit to what I've seen here. Well, the white people who support BLM hate themselves. They hate their race and they want to see white people suffer. I want none of that side. They've been indoctrinated by communists and universities to think of white people as evil oppressors. And then we have to pay the price for what some ancestors did 200 years ago. Next one, are you okay? That's not an argument, Fimoid. Fimoid, don't fuck yourself with football. Well, listen, lady.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_196.mp3:  May I have your attention please? Will the real moon man please stand up? I repeat, will the real moon man please stand up? We're gonna have an ethnic cleansing here. Well act like you've never seen a moon man before. Choose all dead on the floor, like Hitler and Stalin just burst in the door and started warping the grass horse then before. Expelled them by force throwing away in his life furniture. It's the return of the grand wizard of the KKK. He did that just say what I think he did to me and SJW said nothing. You guys, SJWs are dead there, locked in my basement. Them and his women love moon man. Chigga, chigga, chigga, moon man. I love him, look at him, walking around grabbing his giant mooncock, flipping the niggers and Jews. Yeah, but he's so cute though. He's evil. Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's going on in Forgiss and Misery. Sometimes I wanna start shooting blacks and Spicks and Jews. But it's cool for niggers to shoot our police officers. My cock is on your lips, my cock is on your lips. And if Imlucky, you might just give it a little kiss and that's the message that we deliver to little nigs and expect them to know every demon education is. Of course they've gone unknowable with the guys. By the time they hit fourth rate, they are on the Discovery Channel. Aren't they? Niggers are nothing but animals. Well, some of them are cannibals who cut other people open like hand-flops. But if they can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason why a nigger should end be at the end of a rope. But if you feel, but I feel, I got the antidote. Chiboons wave your panty hose, sing the chorus, and it does cause in the moon man. Yes, the real moon man. All you other moon men are just imitating. So won't the real moon man please stand up? Please stand up. Please stand up. Cause in the moon man. Yes, the real moon man. All you other moon men are just imitating. So won't the real moon man please stand up? Please stand up. Please stand up. Eminem doesn't say nigger at his rap style records. Well, I do. So fuck them and fuck you still. You think I give a damn about a minority? Half of you kikes can't even stomach me, let alone stand me. But movement, what if they didn't, I'd be weird why? So you guys could just lie to get me here. Maybe you sit me here next to Audrey in a patridge? Yo shit, Anders Bravik better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Dylan Root and Ben Garrison. And here, MRU over who killed niggers and Jews first. Little kikes, I dare you to put you on MTV. Yeah, he's cute, but I think he wants to gas Jews. He'll be. I should send you to my camp for free. And show the whole world how you gave moon man BD. Im sick of you little kikes nigger kids. All you do is annoy me. So I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me? Who just don't give a fuck like me? Who dress like me? Shoot figures and spicks like me. It just might be the next best thing. But not quite me. Cause if the moon man, yes the real moon man. All you other moon men are just imitating. So won't the real moon man please stand up? Please stand up. Please stand up. Cause if the moon man, yes the real moon man. All you other moon men are just imitating. So won't the real moon man please stand up? Please stand up. Im like a head trip to listen to cause i'm only giving you things you joke about with your friends inside your living room. The only difference is i got the balls to shoot niggers in front of you all and i don't got a fee balls or sugar coated at all. I just grab my gun and start shooting. And whether you like to admit it, i just shit on juice. Better than 90% of you fake clansman out camp. Then you wonder how can fact see up these albums like valiums. It's funny cause of the rate in going when im 30. I'll be the only person in the lesbians clinic serving. And shing fame and astasses when im jacking off with moon ladies and im jerking. But this whole thing of i guys isn't working. And every single person is a moonman working. He could be working at magonal's, Spitting on all of you things or in the parking lot circling. Screaming gas the kikes race war now. With his windows down in the systemo. So will the real moonman please stand up? And seek hyal raising your right arm straight up. And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control. And one more time loud as you can. And doesn't go cause im a moonman. Yes the real moonman. All you other moonman are just imitating. So won't the real moonman please stand up? Please stand up. Please stand up cause im a moonman. Yes the real moonman. All you help us do is happen. So... ...is. Or there's. Or there's. There was. There was. Or. There was. There was. And you don't. The real moonman. That's. And you don't. That's not. You don't. Because. That's not. Get out of 5 mil. Yes, there is a movement in all of us.

So I guess just talk to this little bit about what just happened after passing out after a particular episode. Okay. So I had a sinkable episode. I have a history of having an overactive vagal response. So with that, if I have pain from anything, pain now or something like that, I can just pass out. So what happened is I started getting, I get an aura before of filling weak, dizzy, disoriented, and it just hit me all of the sudden. I felt really deaf, red, again. I could feel it coming on, so I felt a little disoriented. But I feel fine now. And the pain in my arm is very minimal, actually, but it doesn't take much. So you feel fine now? I feel fine now. And this is, you know, I have passed out probably six times in the past six weeks. You know, it's common for me. No, we're not taking the vaccine. No. So I mean, like I said, a hang-nell can cause me to have this. So this is common for me. It is for me. Yes. Okay. Yes. Typically, like I said, I can feel it coming on and I could, but I was trying to push through, but, you know. Okay. Thanks for talking. Oh, yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you. Around to be monitored for a few minutes. One of those is in case you have an allergic reaction that's exceptional and rare with any vaccine, but theoretically possible. We recommend being on the safe side with that. If people have a history of having hypersensitivity reactions, not of an allergic nature, but getting nervous or getting a little bit light-headed after a painful stimulus, sometimes just sitting down for 10 minutes before getting back up is advisable and can prevent this kind of thing from happening. Because, translate the blood pressure can just lower a little bit, basically just from an increased vagal tone to the nervous system. So what do you think was the case here? I think that she got a shot in the arm and made her feel a little bit light-headed and she's recovered now. It's happened before, apparently. Okay. So this is normal, let me have here for this first time. It is a reaction that can happen very frequently with any vaccine, with a shot of any kind. There's no reason to be concerned with the vaccine. Kind of like if you've been to the doctor and had blood work done before, some people get a little light-headed when they see the needle going into their skin. This is the identical kind of reaction. Yeah, no reason to suspect that that's due to the vaccine whatsoever. But if you're afraid of needles or have a history of getting a little bit worked up or more sensitive around needles, take a minute afterwards and catch your breath. All right. If that didn't happen to somebody, what's the protocol? We are getting light-headed, what do you mean? Sit down. Sit down, have somebody fan you a little bit? Take a drink of water for people who have diabetes and are on insulin or have a predisposition to getting low blood sugar. Having a little bit of glucose in the form of a cookie or crack or something can help you because sometimes typo glycemic can present this way as well. But just sitting down and taking a minute before going about your day. All right. All right. Thank you. All right. All right. Thank you.\n",

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_425.mp3:  Hey guys, what up? So I am here stuck at the chas because I gave away my last $20 at my parent's spend amount to me to two black people as per the request of our leaders. So I figured you know a good way to start making a little bit of money so I can eat and drink water because I'm not allowed to touch any of the black people stuff. I thought you know I could just start a chasersized class. It's a great idea right? So we're just going to start out with a few little moves. I'm going to show you how they go. So our first move we're going to be doing is we're going to take a knee and then we're going to throw out the commie fist. So let's do it. One, two, three. Take a knee, commie fist. Take a knee, commie fist. Two more. Take a knee, commie fist. And take a knee, commie fist. Beautiful people, beautiful. So the next one we're going to be working shoulder mobility. So we are going to take our hand, we're going to reach back for our wallets, we're going to take them out and we're going to hand them to black people. Okay other side, take out your wallets, hand them to the black people. Good job everybody. Okay. So this one, we're going to be working the core. Core is very important especially when you're running from the popo. So we're going to put our hands up like this and every time we see a non-white walking biopinat bow down, from the bow down if you want to increase the intensity a little bit you can grow up and eat as your valued down. Just don't bow down to any white person, okay? Or your surprise just not to eat. Okay anyways we're going to move on now our next move is punch and not to eat. So you can eat a punch and not to eat in real life. We're going to just shadow box to know to pretend there's a notch in there and you know stop a stopwatch stretch. Okay our last move is going to be a visible backpack. Now many of you probably don't know what I'm talking about but it is your invisible backpack of white privilege. You were carrying around with you everywhere you go. Nobody can see it. Nobody knows what's in it, what it's made up of. So we're just going to put that invisible backpack on which you have. We don't question it and we're going to do some squats with all of that white privilege on your back that's just weighing you down. Just get rid of it. Give away your privilege, give away your money, give away your life. So I hope everybody enjoyed my chasercise class. If you want to donate um your cracker what are you doing? Just doing chasercise class Tyrone just trying to you know earn a little money so I can eat. Chas we don't call chas no more it's called chop like chopping off the heads of white supremacists. Oh yeah that's so cool yeah totally okay um so let's add one more move right why not so this one is going to be called the chop. You're going to go down, I'm going to chop, chop off the white people's heads and white supremacy. Well thank you so much everybody for decolonizing fitness with me today and um I hope you give me some money so I can get out of here and not die. Okay bye thanks guys, life life's better.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_380.mp3:  The truth is the most important thing there is without truth we have nothing because in order to have something it needs to exist and you don't know or something exists if you don't have the truth. So knowingly ignoring the truth to a piece of the word is the greatest possible sacrifice one can make. To sacrifice the truth to a piece of the word is to accept the belief that the word is more important than existence itself. We should inherently self-destruct ourselves. And the thing is the majority of people are involved in doing that right? So if you don't have someone at the bottom of this primarily considered important, telling the group what to think and you just leave the group to the order to buy us this. You're fine because the group, when left to think for themselves, is inherently self-destructed, it makes me sick. This world makes me physically sick to my stomach. It's like I have told where the children decide how I'm candy-like and when they can do it then. Where's the bottom? Where is where is where is the man who understands that people need to be forced to do what is uncomfortable because as children they want to make a decision to self. They want to keep searching or feel good for what feels good to do when good for you. Why? Hey! So what I say, we can genocide a fucking crime. Just like God tells us to do in the Bible, it feels uncomfortable. But if you are able to see the castions in every world of life, you would understand why the crime is the majority of people are system wise. They're not physically capable of doing the connection of those people that are just among the dead. Exactly! So what I say is that I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being. I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being. I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being. I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being. I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being. I'm not a human being, I'm not a human being.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_356.mp3:  Hey people, this is a story of how I learned to cure my coon dog from COVID. It's a coon dog, is it a dog that'll here run up a coon up the wrong tree. And the wrong tree is a tree that that coon doesn't have a hole in it so he can't hide. And so these dogs is trying to run out in the woods and tree a coon and sound off. And then the hunter will come and shoot that coon down. And it may coon skin hats. And if you ever eat a coon, you'll know the real reason why they like the coon. It's like the best roast beef you ever had. And so it's been going on for a long time and most joe coon hunters, they weren't really highly educated. So 30 years ago, I was living in Old River, Shanny. And a girl across the river brought me this big beautiful black puppy. He looked to be like a black lab, but we knew the parent parents and it was actually a roadesian ridge back in Kaio de Mix. And I had spent a lot of time with that dog trying it. I wasn't a coon hunter, but I was teaching him party tricks and he was the most obedient dog. Everybody in town knew that dog. Anyway, I went, the kids would run up and they all knew his name. I didn't know how, but everybody knew my dog. And so he was about dog nine months to a year and he had hacked and coughed a couple times during training. So I brought it to the vet. He was a really good dog and he went through all his checkup and she was just loving him and took some blood and she came back in later and she held my hand and told me that my dog had heartworms. And I said, how much is this going to cost? So she went to explain in the life cycle of heartworms to me. And she explained how the heartworms live in deer out in the field and they draw blood out of that deer and it'll have these microfilli heartworms, little tiny ones that'll fit up in that syringe. And it'll bring them and when it went and stuck it in your dog, sometimes it let some of that blood back out and those little microfilli come out. And then they go through a life cycle of growing inside your dog. And so they breed and so you have many different sizes. You know, you have the tiny babies and you have them growing. You have them growing until they're five, four or five foot long. They'll attach there in the heart like a hookworm and you know the heart will pump that blood and they'll hang back. You know the heart pumps that blood to the lungs first. So that's why they start hacking and they get a little cough and then you know that worm gets so long, he's old and it starts to break off, you know. And after that blood goes to the lungs and it pumps through the brain and it goes back through the cycle and they dissolve and come out into feces and it's a really ugly sight the way she explains it to you. And I says, yeah but you know what's it going to cost me to cure this and she squeezed my hand and she said $2,000. And I was living here on the river shanty so I kind of shook her hand loose and I told her that oh me and my dog just aren't that attached. She had let me know that you know they were only in that first second stage that were small still and the price even goes up to bigger they get. So I went back home and went next door to the bait shop. If you don't know what a bait shop is, it's like a bar room on a river except sometimes they can sell you some worms. Might even have some hooks or sinkers there. And I was telling no girl that operates the bait shop that about it and she says you know my boyfriend he takes care of his coat of dogs. He knows something about that. So I was back at my place later on that day and this guy come by he looked about like this except a little meaner and uglier. Look real country. And she apparently had told him that he couldn't talk to me about it. And so he told me he says you know we got a whole lot of money you know the country boys and they couldn't we don't have a whole lot of cash we take care of our own dogs. He says I'm gonna tell you how how we do it. It's the same way that the veterinarians do it. He says uh go to the co-op and ask him for some cattle worm or this I have a mech injection. I don't I don't think they had all the others back down anyway. So get your bottle at I have a mech and they'll get you some syringes that go with it. And he says get you some seven and one shot while you're there for parvo and get him a couple hundred pound warmer pills and go through the regular routine you know you give him the seven one and you give him a week and then give him a hundred pound worth of warmer pills. Have a much dog ways that they might if you dog way seven they might give you a 50 in a 20 and uh and you just go through uh you know give it to him and then give him a couple weeks and then and then do it again. And what you're doing is you just you're killing you're killing the big ones in the small ones you know they breed in that time you miss um during the breeding weather and a egg cycle you miss them so you let them grow up big enough before that they have time and breed again and kill them again and that's why you you wait that certain amount of time between them. And he says the the trick is you don't want to kill all these worms because that heart when they die that heart is going to pump them to the lungs and then they're going to go straight to the brain and they're going to give that dog a stroke and kill it. He says the trick is to just kill the smallest ones first he said give them a little bit of dose and you're killing the small ones first and you can go through time take your time until so just a few you know just some of them die off slowly and they don't all go into the brain all at one time he says way up your dog and however much your dog weighs then Jackson is going to be that many millimetres and so luckily my dog weighed a hundred pounds and he made this really easy but you have to do a little more math if your dog's different your dog's bigger or smaller he says start with a dime just 10% he says don't for a couple days don't feed your dog any fatty foods and you know if it's hot out right inside where it's cool you know don't stress your dog and give him a dime so my dog's first dose was just at this 10 here and so this old syringe got a needle on it because you're going to have to draw it out a little rubber top on the bottle but you don't inject it into the dog you just unscrew the end and just feed it to him in the mouth and it must taste good because you know the dogs hate to take medicine they know it's up but after I would give it to him come back and try to lick this syringe and get it all out so it must taste good and just keep your eye on your dog and make sure he's doing all right you know if something should happen then you have to rush to the vet and tell him what you did and then you know just give him 10 days 10 days 14 days and you just you know you killed the smallest ones the big ones that little dose didn't affect him and so 14 later 14 days later 10 14 days later you double that dose up you know so that I brought it to 20 and do the same thing you know for a couple days before that don't feed him a lot of real fatty foods make sure they're cool not out in the heat stressing and if your dog didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you know a lot of times if they got bad heartworms they'll get sick the first time if they didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you're probably going to be all right just go on out throughout the process you know and raise it up to to a 20 then in the second week so it was it was you know the the first week I give him a warmer pill I give him 10 days and then I give him a warmer pill and you're trying to kill all the little smaller parasites before you go attack this big problem and give it a week and give him a 71 injection and then 71 injection you know he's going to inject in under the skin and the and then give him 10 days weeks and give him a booster if you haven't never give him a 71 before you'll have to do a booster on it but I've always given my dogs her 71 and their warmer pills always did that myself and so there's no need for the booster so I give it 10 days and I give him the 10% and it barely hit him you know he didn't he didn't really lay down a lot he didn't make him real sick I knew it was okay like she told me it was the lowest degree that weren't real big and so 10 14 later days later I raised up to a 20 in same process 10 14 days later I raised up to a 40 same process 10 14 days later I raised up to 80 same process and then 10 days later I give him the full dose at the 100 and then you know after that if if you have bad mosquito problem you could just give him this full dose you know the their full dose 100 pound dog took the two hundred million and you could just do that every month and if you don't have the the mosquitoes you know year round you can just wait to the mosquitoes is there and you can you can wait two months you know and give him a half dose one month and then a full dose two weeks later you know you can skip a couple months and give him a half dose or you can wait a year when the mosquitoes come back around and start at the dime the 20 and go through the routine but this is this is your your heart warmer you know you don't have to give him the heart warmer you really don't this kills everything you don't have to give him any of the other shots this kills every worm every parasite and the reason you're wanting to kill all these worms in your cattle is so they eat and get fat you know you don't want them wasting the food you don't want hookworms and you puppy you know you feed your puppies forever and they never get any waste because the hookworms is eating all the nutrition they get no nutrition on their food so Koon hunt ain't the same as it used to be now they have shows where they don't shoot the Koon and they just rate the dogs and and the winner gets all kind of cash and prizes and I've heard 25,000 and hooked sometimes so about 15 years ago I was building a barn for a local vet Marion and I went by his office in a gallon jar up on the counter with the dogs hard in it and it was just full of four or five foot long heartworms and I knew that was my chance to get the girl to talk you know because in their hippocritic oath they can't say anything about it it's I told her the story of how I treated my dog when he had heartworms and I told her the whole story exactly how I did it and all she could say was that should have worked you know it's the same when you go down to buy I've meant they're not going to tell you that that's what it's for they can't tell you that it's illegal for them it's the same reason that they take movies down and so I had posted the movie the other day about this doctor core he was two days ago he's in a senate hearing and he told all about all the studies and how this Ivo mech is the miracle treatment for COVID and that movie lasted less than 20 minutes they pulled it down but I put it up here on my hidden history on bitch shoot you can see the movie here and I leave the link underneath here so my dog had lived another 13 years after that he was loved by all I treated many other people's dogs that I knew was was too poor to treat their dogs for heartworms and I never had a problem I haven't lost the dog yet I still do it today and coon hunting has changed since like I say they don't even shoot the coon much anymore now you got a lot of doctors and lawyers running coon dogs prestige you know just to say they won so I'm going to investigate further into this and see if I can find a human dosage but I would bet it's the same as the dog a million for a pound all right I'm going to cut this off here a good day\n",

Few commentaries on this global warming hoax have had greater relevance than this. I think I might send it to our galore, and it says this. To all the school kids going on strike for climate change, you're the first generation who've required air conditioning in every classroom. You want TV in every room, and your classes are all computerised. You spend all day and night on early electronic devices. More than ever, you don't walk or ride bikes to school, but you arrive in caravans of private cars that chokes suburban roads and worse in Russia are traffic. You're the biggest consumers of manufactured goods ever, an update perfectly good, expensive luxury items to stay trendy. Your entertainment comes from electric devices. Furthermore, the people driving your protests are the same people who insist on actually inflating the population growth through immigration, which increases the need for energy, manufacturing and transport. The more people we have, the more forest and bushland we clear. The more of the environment that's destroyed. How about this? Tell your teachers to switch off the aircon. Walk or ride to school. Switch off your devices and read a book. Make a sandwich instead of buying manufactured fast food. Now, none of this will happen, because the piece says you're selfish, badly educated, virtues signaling little turds, inspired by the adults around you, who crave a feeling of having a noble cause, while they indulge themselves in Western luxury and unprecedented quality of life. The piece ends by saying, wake up, grow up and shut up until you're sure of the facts before protesting.\n",

I'll be directed to answer the question. The answer is not appropriate, but it's on the bottom two lines of that page. Point of order, when will the clock start, Mr. Chairman?

You can try and feed me leftist potion in an attempt to try and save them, but you won't take the sting out of bear mace before I spray them. Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from killing nickers. When I say I'm a kill and a girt, I do it. I don't give a damn what you think. I'm doing this for me. So fuck the multicultural sheep. They're smoking crack. But they think they're stopping me. I'm a hate what I set out to hate without a single fucking break. And all those who look down on the outshfits is where I am masturbate. No ifs and no but stones ask me why. Or how can I? From property value down to the uprise in rubberies, minorities still stealing property paid by our salaries until they're fucking slaughtered or sent back to their own countries which ever comes first for better or worse. I don't give a fuck. You'll get a fuck you for Christmas. Nickers belong in a curse for geth a curse. Just with those nickers in the dirt and cleanse the whole universe. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid to take a stand against niggers. So everybody except for niggers come take my hand. Come take my hand. We'll end this race together killing non-whites. Cause white is better when we unite. Just letting you know that you're not alone. So let me know if you think you could break a nigger's jaw. Playing with a spray cannon should step the fuck back. I should then have to run these words into rhythm for you to know I hate blacks. I said I could swing. And I smashed out that nigger's teeth. So fuck Martin Luther King and everything he preached. And to the fans I'll never let you down again. Moonman's back. I promise I never stop killing the blacks. In fact let's be honest for last nigger I seen that got away. Perhaps the following day he was hung by the triple K. Relax I'm not going slack on blacks now. All I'm trying to say is that's your last line of crap. Cause I ain't playing around. It's a game called drop to the ground. And the police know how to drop filthy niggers down. But I'm still trying to wipe all the blacks out. Thought I had it met out. But I guess I did and these fucking black clowns are still vandalizing town. So it's time these niggers, these spearchuckers, fuck off back to Africa. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid to take a stand against niggers. So everybody, except for niggers, come take my hand, come take my hand. We'll end this race together killing non-whites cause white is better when we unite. Just letting you know that you're not alone. So let me know if you think you could break a nigger's job. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today. I'm killing 12 nigs a day. I'm standing up. I'm a face those niggers. I'm moon manning up. I'm a shoot them down. I've had enough. Now I'm so fed up time to put this country back together right now. It was my decision to get an M16. I did it for me. Admittedly, I probably caused many crime scenes for you. So white power can come back and see a new moon. You don't even realize how much I love killing coons. I've been shooting niggers. Giving leftists and liberals the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye. From macing that nigger. In my world, niggers can make like left winners and drop dead. No more niggers means no more drama from now on. So I promise to focus solely on crushing the population of these incompatible black cunts. So I solemnly swear to always treat niggers like my washed socks and hang them. If they weren't so fucking ugly, I would bang them. Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club. With my coffee mug and beat all the spear chuckers up. Cause I'm raising the bar. I would shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy using the bar. Too beat the fuck out of course. I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to take a stand against niggers. So everybody, except for niggers, come take my hand, come take my hand. We'll end this race together. Killing non-whites cause white is better when we unite. Just letting you know that you're not alone. So let me know if you think you can break a nigger's job.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_626.mp3:  Children had only just started to head back to school in France, but after only one week of classes around 70, are having to shut down once more, as cases of COVID-19 have been detected. We've always wanted to contact Avon. It is probably a virus that was contracted before returning to school after exiting confinement. We'll see what the analyses say. This is what many teachers and their unions had warned about. They implored the government not to reopen schools, fearing that they could become hot spots for the transmission of virus. Parents had also been raising their own concerns. They've been asking us if we want to send the kids back, and you know, in mixed feelings, everything just opened up. So we're actually sort of continuing as we were for a few weeks to see what happens in the next three weeks. I personally think we're going to end up back in lockdown. I don't feel like everything's opened up, though, because the danger has gone. I think everything has opened up because, financially, they can't afford to keep it closed, and because people are losing their minds. But I think it was also opened up because now, if a whole lot of people get ill, there are beds and ventilators. Though many measures were put in place to stop the virus spreading, it appears that they just weren't enough. The government insists the schools that are closing down again are only a small percentage overall. And it says the consequences of children not going to school are more serious. However, while the number of children who've contracted COVID-19 is relatively small, there is another alarming trend that's been emerging. Last week, France registered the first case of a child dying from a rare complication linked to coronavirus. The child presented symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease, the serological test done within the pediatric ICU unit, indicated that he had been in contact with a coronavirus. Without developing the symptoms the prior week. It's rare inflammatory disease that normally affects children under the age of five. But since the COVID pandemic, children across the world have been showing similar symptoms. In France, there have been more than 100 reported cases since the beginning of March. At present, parents in France can decide whether or not to send their children back to school. But given these new cases of COVID-19 centered around reopened schools and the surge in more complex cases involving children, many parents just may decide that it is still too risky, shall it even ski or tea Paris?\n",

Here we go Someone asks when it's cold out and you're doing and you're doing back-to-back videos Do you like to use Coleman propane stove folding Kirk's turno stove or hit to eat your hot chocolate piece? Loving happiness none. I used to do alcohol stoves and I used to make them for people and I even made little kits because at the time you could get a Beef stew can that was exactly the right size to cook a meal pattern as we called it It's a set of meals that you do very efficiently not waste any water and it would warm you up And it would be really good and it would make sure that you did not produce carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide excessively in a tent. I don't do that anymore. Heat damage is tense because the most I made out of polyester and whatever Number one number two I eat before I go up that way I don't have to relieve myself when I'm in the woods Not having to do You know taking care of the little bits and pieces of my life is much easier. I Just make sure I don't have anything to expel now. I'm bringing this up The multiple things for maintenance when you are homeless are the same as when you're a prepper And even military people reference this if you do not have to do something that puts you in a compromising condition You're better off When you have to live in a tent or you're homeless the last thing on earth you want to deal with is your digestive system or bladder doing something Inconvenient being horribly sick recently brought this up because it doesn't matter what I did. I was gonna be sick wherever it would happen It's the most debilitating and Defeating thing you can go through to have your body basically turn on you because there's no choice It's trying to get rid of a disease or infection And it takes away your ability to even stand up And it becomes a Problem because now if it's really really cold, you know something that will conduct heat away from you and you're now dehydrated and get the idea and that's the next step not having to do anything when I'm not sick make sure I don't get sick I still claim myself obviously you have to or you're gonna get sick after to care the bits and pieces while I'm dealing with this So it's a very good idea to reduce the number of times a week or day have to do anything or at least make it to work in time It can almost time a life by it as the joke goes in the military. You should be able to set your watch by it So next on a video I did of the 1974 non-human Piracaris skull mitochondria DNA test collective evolution ancient origins and Facebook BS Talking about it Someone posted comment on this I'm gonna bring up a couple of things, but here we go No, that was not actually something that would work and yes the analysis was done to sell books and and TV show you know Visits and that sort of thing Next someone says most of our DNA is exactly the same as the banana. No, it's not Is that ever real or is it BS? No, most of the DNA chains can be found as duplicated in other creatures You would expect that DNA sequences aren't literally totally unique within a short duration and some protein sequences are duplicated Humans don't produce vitamin C other life forms do We lost the ability to do that at one point Changed out for being bald I guess but anyway Look how many species have gone extinct? Why wouldn't a species of human be under the same threat? true The other thing is I have to point out we chimpanzees and bonobos are probably related to some common ancestor for a weird reason We have one fewer chromosomes than let's say or chromosome pairs then let's say chimpanzee and One of our chromosomes has an end piece that looks like the ends of the chimpanzees one but it's stuck together Now this is something that isn't just a coincidence it does indicate that we're freaks We're mutation and that kind of mutation happens all the time with a virus or or even gamma rays hit DNA chains reduces the number of chromosomes Contrary to a tool song you don't increase you decrease possibly Anyway, I just thought it was an interesting set of subjects. Thanks for watching have a good day and good luck with that\n",

Investment banks, not the commercial ones, but the point is they carry out in those realms the exact same principles that they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life, and they de-rassinate society. Dressinate. Tear out the roots. The real people derives as genius from the land, from the sun, from the sea, from the soil, you know, this is how they know themselves. But like Jews don't even have soil. Those aren't Jews. Of course, they're Jews. Notice the Israelis. It's a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil, because the real Jew is a wanderer. He's a nomad. He's got no roots and no attachments. So he universalizes everything. He can't hammer a nail or plow a field. All he can do is buy and sell and invest capital and manipulate markets and, you know, it's like all mental. He takes a life of a people that's rooted in soil, and then he turns it into this cosmopolitan culture, based on books and numbers and ideas and, you know, this is his strength. You can take the greatest Jewish minds ever. Marks, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us? Communism, infantile sexuality, and the atom bomb. In the mere three centuries, it's taken these people to emerge from the ghettos of Europe. They've ripped us out of a world of order and reason. They've thrown us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges, relativity. Into a world where now the very existence of matter and meaning is in question. Why? Because it's the deepest impulse of a Jewish soul to pull at the very fabric of life till there's nothing left but a thread. There was nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_67.mp3:  Today we are going to be looking at one of the justifications given from Muhammad's marriage to 60-year-old Ayesha. Let's go ahead and watch the video. Now let us look at the fruit that came from the tree so we can understand it. Who was Ayesha Radevaranda? She is the woman that memorized the Quran when the Quran was revealed, when the last ayats of the Quran, the last 636 Ayes were revealed. Three months later Ayesha had memorized the whole Quran. Think about that. Secondly, let's look at Ayesha Radevaranda. Ayesha Radevaranda, because she lived with the Prophet Slavs. She saw him, she understood him intimately, clearly, her mind was bright and she was a powerful young girl, a very aggressive young girl, powerful, aggressive and deep and intelligent. Memorize the whole Quran and guess what? She was holding with her when the Prophet Slavs passed away at least 2,600 Ayesha Deeds that nobody else knew. That's why after Abu Huraira Radevaranda nobody related to us more Hades than Ayesha Radevaranda. So the justification given from Muhammad's marriage to a child is that Ayesha was able to memorize the Quran within a matter of months and also that because she knew the Prophet so intimately she was able to provide many of the Hadeef that are now used to assist Muslims in determining how to live their lives in a way that is pleasing to Allah. However, is this sufficient justification for Muhammad marrying a child and making child marriage a part of the Islamic religion was there no other way that the Quran could be recorded or the Hadeef collected? And of course the obvious answer is no. There are many different ways that the Quran could have been recorded and preserved that did not involve child marriage. For example, Allah could have simply invented a pen given one of his followers some paper and taught them how to read and write. In my opinion that would have been a much more moral way to preserve the Quran. But let me know what you think in the comment section. If you liked this video, hit the like button, subscribe, hit the notification button and I'll see you in the next video where I'll be giving a slightly more serious and in-depth analysis of another of the justifications of child marriage in the Islamic religion.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_59.mp3:  Someone's stalking us. Did you just stab him? Whoa, he just stabbed him dude. In this video we get to watch some antifa beat up an antifa before dragging his ass down to the police who arrest him for stabbing black rebel. Okay, that last part's not funny, but it is funny watching antifa beat up other antifa. I'm getting them arrested. In the middle of a riot that's all about, you know, we hate the police. That's what it's all about, right? The police are racist. We're having a riot against the police. They dragged one of their own to the police after beating them up. This is so great. But the stabbing part is not. Anyway. Yeah, feel free to use whatever you need just on my page. You don't even have to ask. I won't come after you later for it. Again, like I said, you do good work. I appreciate it. Well, alright, thanks. Cool. And likewise to you too, I appreciate what you do for America as does my wife, right, Abby? He's out there driving around America doing his thing and just, you know, basically he's kind of like a cheerleader for America. I mean, it's challenging everybody's narrative too. Even my own. I don't quite understand. But I respect the guy that's for sure. So if you folks don't already know Drew, aka black rebel was stabbed in Portland at night 55, 56 or so of riding straight riding. Apparently by an antifa pedophile. And wow, we're hearing more, more, more antifa pedophiles these days. I don't know what's going on there. Anyway. Yeah, maybe they feel emboldened enough to just be open up. I'm not sure. But for more details on what happened here of the stabbing, see the link below for part one. And also see the links below to Drew's channel, black rebel. And maybe at some point there will be a link to a go fund me or some other fundraiser for Drew. If you may need it for hospital bills and or to pay you bill for this rental car, we'll get into that later. But here we go with part two. Let us have a look at Drew's Twitter. I have not looked at this yet. I want to make something clear. Um, go ahead. This guy didn't decide that he was just going to shh, fucking shake Drew out of nowhere. No, this wasn't reactionary because Drew put his arm around his shoulder and talked to him. No, this was not that Drew only talked to that man in that manner because he had been stalking them all night with his hand firmly clasped underneath his overalls. That's weird. I would be alerted too. Is there a weapon in there? Is he got gun in there? Yeah. Is he fucking playing with his dick in there? I don't know. He's doing something. He's following us. That's going to get you to me a fucking problem. Yeah, especially because we know this and Drew may be a little physically aggressive with a slap on the fucking shoulder as he hugged him. But that's what you do when somebody is fucking stalking you. You make Dan sure everybody in public knows you're talking to this piece of shit. That's what Drew did. Yeah. This man, this, no, sorry, I'm not even gonna call him a man. This fucking pervert, this Antifa pervert. Stop them, hunt him and wait up for the most opportune moment to try and murder him. That's what happened. Antifa are a bunch of opportunistic fucking cowards and murderers. They also like sticking their body parts in children. On Drew's timeline at 9.59pm on the 24th, Haley Adams, you folks may remember Haley Adams from Portland's Liberation, tweeted, stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. We all, and by the way, Haley's supposed to be a white Nazi, even though she's at least part Jewish, I think. But here we have a white Jewish Nazi concerned with black people and Latino people. Wow. Anyway, stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. We all know how you guys love to assault and beat on people of color in Portland. She's absolutely right. Didn't I just say that a short while ago? At Space Force, USA, that's Drew. And at deplorable low, that's Gen Low, life matters. In other words, she's saying this black man and this brown woman's life matters. Put an end to terrorism and racism. Leave my friends alone, communist scums. And then she linked to the tweet that has since been protected by Twitter. Because they like to protect these kind of people. We see you, Twitter. We see you. We see you, Jack. You're not Twitter. You're child rapist syndicate. That's what it is. You're Twitter loves their pedophiles. Oh, yeah, they do. Oh, God, we've got all the pedophiles on the plant right here. Twitter. We take top. Tiktok is number two on who has the most pedophile. Yeah, but Twitter is Twitter considers child rape to be a sexual orientation. Yes, they're lumping in gay people and bisexual people with child rapists. And where are the people who are wrong? Where are the ones that apparently don't sympathize with the gay or trans community? No, excuse me. I do. And I don't think that you lumping them in with fucking child rapists is a fair thing to do. Because I have gay friends. They don't rape children. I have trans friends. They don't rape children. Yeah. You know why? Because they're decent human beings. They're just a little different. You as holes are perverts. Rap is not a sexual orientation. It is not. It's perverted, disgusting. And I don't care how you swing it. You can't just walk and be chopped into pieces and put a box and something to the bottom of the ocean. Dirt bags. Yeah. Now, what else? I feel like there was something else I wanted to go over. Okay, yeah, we got to go back to this. But that was on the 24th and the stabbing, by the way, happened on the 24th, okay? So they threatened these people, threatened to do it, and then they did it. All right? And I challenge any of you people out there to find any examples of antifod denouncing this. I'll wait. Okay, so it was at 3.35 a.m. last night, the 25th, that drew, tweeted this, all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher. Wow, this is, this is scary foreshadowing. This is scary. Before he got stabbed, he was talking about all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher and folks, hopefully, you know about that. And by the way, there was a black man killed in another city, a black Trump supporter killed in another city in Milwaukee. Thank you, Tappy. And I have not even had time to look into that other than just hearing about it. I'll give you a small thing. He's a black pro Trump supporter. He's very vocal about it. He stands on the same corner with his signs pasted all over a building. And I think it was yesterday or was it today? It was yesterday. He got in a scuffle over some asshole trying to steal his signs, some anti-drug delusional fuck wit, most likely a BLM trying to steal his signs. And he fought back and they shot him. And he died. Yeah. He died for what he stood for. And you know what? Brave man. Brave man. And I hope whoever fucking killed him dies in the most horrendous way humanly possible. And if I get, if I'm lucky and I work the odds of the fucking lot of that, some of the people drop in my hands. That's what I want. That's what I want. That's not okay. It's not okay. But anyway, black rebel tweeted this. All of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, that mace was brought to you by the courtesy of the black rebel. And then we have people saying, oh yeah, well, then you deserve to be stabbed. Okay. Yeah. 11 hours ago from when I'm recording this 6 o'clock, I am he tweeted that I got stabbed in Portland and I on my way to the hospital. And we have an Instagram link. And it's basically just the same thing. Okay, so I don't need that. All right. Now let's have a look at this tweet by Drew from H 21 a.m. on the 25th. All right. You guys. I got stabbed. I'm on my way to the hospital. I card from medical school. So, a bad picture isn't all about his title. And then I come back on your watch. I had to just make my hair clean. Don't focus. I guess mine. Okay, you guys, I'm gonna get off here in the morning. He's fucking on my brain. But I'm on the way to hospital. I'm gonna let you down. Something to keep a dude. I was following the time, bro. I also want to ask him what happened. He's down here. So I keep you guys updated. So there you go, folks. This is what things are coming down to. Let's look at what else he's got here. This is probably from the undisclosed hospital bed. Twitter is to blame for a lot of the senseless attacks against conservative journalists. They remove alt-right groups, but refuse to recognize the doxing by all left or domestic terrorist groups like Antifa who openly encouraged this type of violence every day. And it's not just alt-right. It's everybody who's not far left that they find. If they find them, oh, there is one. It's like that. It's like from, you know, Pink Floyd's wall. There is one up and they get them up against the wall. There's one in the spotlight. He doesn't think right. Get them up against the wall, you know? That one is black and he knew you've used a Tova line. Made it make an example of them all. And there are a woman of color not following and not fitting in our box. Get her up against the wall if I had, you know? And there, that one's a Jew. They have attack Jews. That one's got spots. If I've had my way, I'd have all of them shot. And I'm sure they would. What are we here? Drew is retreading as you know, his tweet where he says, a mob beats a man in the middle of downtown Portland, they say he stabbed someone. Oh, okay. Let's look at this then. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Where are you going? Why wasn't that brought up? Where are you going? Where's you going? Come on. I don't remember you. Come on. Go to your Heart. Go to your Heart. Where're you going? Our soldiers are numbing through the matrix with the mug to our syllabus. We'll go cities from here to here to your Heart. I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! The funny thing is, some of these people who are gang stomping this guy, they're going to find out that they were beating up a fellow antifa. And that is a pito, and that he stabbed the black guy, and they're going to be so confused. Wait, did I do a good thing by beating him up or not? I can't tell. Did I just beat up a freedom fighter who fights against black Nazis? Or did I beat up a white Nazi who claims to be fighting against black Nazis who are not? I mean, he's a pito. Did I do a good thing? Do I do a bad thing? Did I attack one of my own? Yeah! That's how morally bank-dropped these people are. Moving on, let's see what else we got here. And then other Tweet by Andy No, reach Tweeted by Black Rebel with the message, I'm glad people stepped in to drag my attacker to the police. He's currently sitting on a $250,000 bail for felony assault. Is this the same video? More chaos in those rooms. And the No's Tweet is more chaos in the streets of downtown Portland at the right. Some person is dragged away. Shit! Yeah, take him to the car! There you go. Now what else we have here? Black Rebel, 48 minutes ago, as of my time. So that's around 6 p.m. East through, or 3 p.m. Pacific. I'm in Portland because it's a free country. And he's responding to this here. Let's see what this is. This is a Tweet by Moszek 2G2. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Richard Blake Happy was arrested on $250,000. Well, you mean $250,000, you wrote $250,000. Why was the Black Rebel on Quote in Portland? That's the shit that, wait, I'm hearing in 5, 4, 3, 2, QAnon. Fox News, Axios will probably have him on instead of the man whose head was split with a rubber bullet. Okay, well, you know, it's not entirely coherent with this guy's trying to say. They're not always that literate, but I think we get the idea. Basically, he deserved it because he was there. He was a Black man who dared to disagree with them in their town. How fucking tolerant of you fucking bigots. And that person was responding to this by Black button on Limited Who tweeted hearing a Black man was stabbed by a guy who was killed. And that person was responding to this by Black button on Limited Who tweeted hearing a Black man was stabbed by a guy who was killed. And that person was responding to this by Black button on Limited Who tweeted hearing a Black man was stabbed by a character clad in all Black. Who was chased to 7-11, but the police came and the man, quote, unquote, escaped. Can anyone verify this feel free to DM me? Maybe they're talking about a different incident. I'm not sure. But this guy is apparently talking about Richard. So, yeah, he deserved it as what this person's saying. Black Rebels response to the question of what were you doing in Portland is I am in Portland because it's a free country. You people don't understand. This is fucking America. You don't get to only town and say get the fuck out of our town that we've heard Antifa say for years now. Get out of our town. Get out of Portland. Get out of Berkeley. Get out of this. It's not yours. It's not fucking yours. Okay. Oh. And then at the same time they have the gall to be like open borders open borders. Get the fuck out of our town. Get the fuck out of our town. I mean, we've even put videos out showing them saying get the fuck out. You do not have that right. You can leave if you don't like it. You have that choice. You don't have to, but you can. But you don't get the force anybody out or keep anybody out. Go fuck yourself. All right, folks, I want to wrap this up. Sorry that this has gone on so long and sorry that I'm putting this out so late. I am working with subpar equipment, subpar connection, everything slow my connection slow my computer slow my microphone and your head doesn't work. Half the time blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, always me who cares who cares. But listen, Drew is probably going to need financial help. Okay, but we have more to come out about this from Drew himself and et cetera. Be careful out there tonight important. It's probably going to be a lot worse. In fact, I will be surprised if nobody dies tonight. All right, folks, stay safe out there. Make sure that you squash these street Nazis. Make sure you subscribe. There was some bichutes so you can hear what we really think about all this that we can't tell you on YouTube. Thanks very much for watching everyone. And Drew man, he'll fast. So I got to say in Jenlos, stay safe. All right, folks, thanks for watching.\n",

So now we will enter in this knowing because sometimes we could die, sometimes we could come back alive. And before entering no towels or anything, they will give you a bar of soap. In this bar of soap there were three initials in German. That I forgot, outer proponents in German, but it means pure Jewish faith into the soap. It was meant that they were making the soap out of the corpse of the living, they make the soap. They were making out of the corpse of the living, many things. They will make you know that parchment to make the doctor to the lampshades. They will make you know, purses for them, for the skin of the dead people, they will make beautiful skin you know, like purses for the Germans. They will make anything, and then the flesh you know, they were sometimes you know, when they burn out, if they were not burned they will use it for to make sausages and to make you know, poloni that they were giving us at night to it. It was you know, like you say, at the beginning we were very cautious, we were after saying Rosalind, we didn't want to touch poloni, not even knowing that it was human, we thought it was from the cow. But then you know, my father won at the beginning 40 days, we will see the men you know, from the other side of the fence, they were electric barb, you know, wires. And then my father that he was very well, I mean, he knew very well, you know, the Hebrew and all these laws and all these. It told us in Hebrew, the namal khuta, dina, which means the law of the government is a law. So if you don't eat, you start when you die. So God knows that. So don't forget about cash road and everything, eat whatever they give you. So at the beginning you know, we didn't want to, even that we knew that, we didn't want to touch that poloni.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_552.mp3:  Whether it's questions about curriculum or incidents of anti-Semitism and hate, the ADL has helped us if we've missed the mark and mentored us and guided us. We mark today with a ceremony of remembrance, solidarity and hope. Through the words of our tradition, with the guidance and love of several of our diverse Jewish community spiritual leaders, may we draw strength and inspiration from those who've come before us as we invoke the guidance and presence of the divine. Fear cannot be the driver of our life. Instead, we need to lead with chesset, with love, with generosity, with compassion, resilience and hope. And I think it is critically important that the federal government recognize the role-ledited place and make sure again that the support is cascading down through various ways through which we can call attention to it and fund programs to combat it. So just because I want to talk about these issues of course is affected me and my family. But I remember what my mom told me when I was nine years old. He said to send up for something even if it means sacrificing everything. The history between the NAACP and the ADL is critically important for us all to understand. The NAACP and the ADL have walked in lockstep in the pursuit of freedom for all people, the right of all of us to be self-determinative and in the quest for the dignity of every human being. And so today, now more than ever, I believe that it is critically important for us to continue that legacy. We have to become the on-welcome guests at the dinner table. And not just for the young people at the table, but to telegraph the message that this is not acceptable. But I think that if anything good can come from this moment, it's for us to think about the fact that, you know, Jewish history is written in the present. We are writing our chapter of Jewish history. I thought that it was a very powerful experience and I've been looking forward to this for a while. I'm probably going to go back to campus and continue to fight the fight against anti-Semitism and not back down and stay strong. Fighting anti-Semitism must be. It must be one of our priorities in the work to create justice, inclusivity, equity, safety and security. So we are in this fight together. Thank you for being here.\n",

You know Goldstein and Silverstein and Goldblum and Silverman. Goldman and Shapiro and Goldberg and Gold and Ride. But do you recall? The big is Tuck knows to Gremlin of them all. Shekelstein the hook knows Kaik had a very large hook nose and if you ever saw it you would even say it's gross. That's disgusting. All of us normal white folk used to laugh and call Shekelstein names. Hook knows draft. Never let old Shekelstein play any Ka-K-K games. Like Han the Niver. And one foggy Christmas Eve moonman went up to Shekelstein and said. Shekelstein with a disgusting hook knows so big who surely are disgrace to mankind. And moonman pull out his block and shot him. As the town folk shouted out with Glee, Luhu they never had to look at Shekelstein's hook nose for the rest of the hernerty. Moonman moonman you're so heroic I love you. You shot that cut dead tonight. Won't you show that massive mooncock call up in my guts tonight? Then I took Audrey in a home and fucked her. With my massive mooncock. We fucked all the way till sunlight. But then I had to go kill niggers. Killing niggers on Christmas morning. It's truly one of life's greatest delights. All of these disgusting shitskins. Are gonna end up shot in the head. All these niggers are going to die. Just like Shekelstein the hook knows Ka-K. Then the world will be pure and white. So let's linch all niggers and Jews this Christmas night. Anyway kids I hope you all enjoyed Moonman's story of Shekelstein the hook knows Ka-K. And as always have a Merry Christmas as long as you're white.\n",

What in the world gives me the right to say what I like and go around, lunching the kikes, live in the violent light like a white kid from the burbs, pacing at night, gaining knowledge. Hidden the coons, go to college and grow up to be a racistism. I just want you all to notice what the liberals do. I know that deep down there's a racist lunar being in you. It just can't be found. But fear's skin is the color of two. Only Aryans can be racist, dude. I thought you knew.

They locked me into this room and they put a red into the room with me. In the meantime there was some fumes that was coming into the room and I don't know how long I was there. I don't know how not but I know that when I opened my eyes the red was dead and I looked at it. After that they opened the door and they took me out and they gave me new clothes and they feed me and they put everything.

The handwriting has been on the wall, clear and legible. Now we got a muzzie turn in fruits into vegetables. It was a great night. It was a homo-cost, bonafide homicide that he lives lost. No pulse just blood on the dance floor. Now the facts are more butt-curtain before look here. A Muslim walks into a bar, an order shots for everybody. Party hard-hard Annie should have killed more but he was not a straight shooter. Almost makes you want to cry like that the gathers in Cooper. It's a tragedy. Too many faggot's got away so instead of Islam they're gonna die from AIDS. If survivors want to feel guilty that's their prerogative but I really hope they will remain HIV-positive. The majority of victims were space-taking loads in the face but this time not from the some had trouble deciding. The victims were in a fight in which bathroom to hide and they weren't sure if their gender matched the one they died at 49 faggots in Watton. Break the sick pot the clock and shoot four the muzzie. Sammikers, Quill and Triggers, yeah it's something to see. They may be ignorant savages but they're working for me. I said 49 faggots in Watton. Break the sick pot the clock and shoot four the muzzie. Sammikers, Quill and Triggers, yeah it's something to see. They may be ignorant savages but they're working for me. Listen. All you see are lies on TV. But you know you can believe that if you hear it from me. False claims, false flags on the internet too. And the mouthpiece behind the wall is guest-proof to shoot. You can't trust a mainstream media. Undeniable they're less reliable than Wikipedia. The dude was a troll and lips took the bait. Now it's gun control in the police state. He said he was ISIS but ISIS never heard of him. He said he had no problem with makers while he murdered them. He said he was had a row with Simon in his farts. It's the SJW culture tearing itself apart. The libtars are having a hard time with this. They want to blame Whitey but it's hard to miss that the shir was a Muslim and the faggit at that. And like most mass shir is he was a Democrat. Back in Shrippack, Newts, Muffin, Banks and Dores and the Jews knew as he got a new high school but that's only how spot crimes tend to go unrequited.

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_142.mp3:  Chris Kuhn, Trash's Joe Biden and all of his quote free stuff. I'm Josh Bernstein-Philinan for Gary Franchine, the next news network. Now remember folks, next news is being heavily censored so please make sure you're still subscribed to the channel, make sure you're still getting your notifications. If you're new to the channel please check out the newsletter in the description below and remember folks we've also been taken out of the suggested videos from time to time so please we're now counting on you to make sure that not only you continue to watch the next news network but that you're sharing it with others so that we can continue to get the word out on the true news. Now let's get to your story. According to Trent Baker from BrightBart report, Senator Chris Kuhn's Delaware Democrat on Friday discussed his support of 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate former Vice President Crazy Joe Biden over the likes of Senator Elizabeth High Cheekbones, Focahontus, Warren from the Lyre Waffa tribe and of course who could forget Bernie Breadline Sanders. Kuhn said that on CNBC's Squawk Box that he is backing Joe Biden because he supports economic growth in the United States and Biden will be solving the problems for average Americans and working to bring the country together. Wow what a statement that is good and roll the split. It's hyperbole. It's hyperbole obviously but I mean any pro private sector, free market pro capitalists that that the specter of a of a Warren or Sanders presidency is absolutely horrifying. Well I think Joe Biden would put us back into our place and we're just talking about Warren or Sanders. I wouldn't walk into any room with any world leader say great to see again great. He said that he's supposedly on off the record he told some private sector leaders that you know with me you don't have as much to worry about as you would with him. Then he gets hammered for that because the woke left is like this guy is going to be in bed with you know what we want growth in this country that's what that's what's produced the jobs the corporations that create the jobs. Yeah that might you can't worry about this is a famous Hubert Humphrey quote you can't worry about the working man and not worry about for whom he's going to work you got to be attentive to the fact that without growth we're fighting over a shrinking pot. So at the end of the day I'm supporting Joe with a whole heart of an Iowa within this weekend I'm optimistic about how he can actually solve the problems facing our country and bring us together. The best way as we were talking about earlier the best way for us to confront a pure competitor in China is to be America again to legislate to solve problems to deal with drug pricing the omitted do you sit alone at and I think Joe are you sitting alone at lunch now? I've actually got a full lunch table of folks who just don't go on Twitter. Okay I don't know I think you're you know even after this interview I think you're going to get some dirty looks down there are you headed back there today maybe he said quote we cannot be the party of free stuff that doesn't work. Well obviously it doesn't work and it's interesting to even see a Democrat agreeing with that. Americans realize this and that's why everyone is hopefully not going to vote for whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being because there is no such thing as free stuff. Everybody pays for it one way or the another whether it's increased taxes whether it's taking from the taxpayers and giving it to the ones that aren't working or more than anything else you're freedom you're always going to pay for it folks those are my thoughts what are yours put them down in the comments below give us a like give us a share continue to watch the next news network I'm Josh Brunstein filling in for Gary French if you want more about me check out the Josh Brunstein show on YouTube and we'll see you on the next report don't go anywhere I want you to imagine if you had received a personal invitation to invest just $50 an Uber when it was a startup well on IPO day you could have made $248,000 that same $50 invested in Amazon before it IPO could have made you over $7 million dollars Mike Marcola was Apple's first angel investor on IPO day his windfall was already 220 plus percent 220 plus thousand percent but that was only when Apple is worth 1.8 billion think about how much Marcola's net worth grew as Apple blazed a path to becoming the first $1 trillion company in US history and without him iPhones Apple watches iPads and other devices we use in our daily lives may have never been invented now look at these surprising returns from these popular startup companies some earning 583,264 percent return on investment friends what would you rather be the angel investor or IPO investor now the choice is clear as day how would you feel if you could get in on the ground floor of the hottest startups this year that everybody is fighting over hmm well fortunately shark tanks Robert hergeveck and his team of ultra successful angel investors are here to help deliver angel deals with 1000 times upside delivered to you on a silver platter so do this watch the free video at getangelrich.com or click the link in the description below to see how you can participate in these lucrative deals before they hit the mainstream markets that's get angelrich.com tap the link below we'll see you at the next report for the next news network I'm Gary thank you for watching that report if you want more subscribe to the channel by clicking on the next news network logo right here you can also watch our latest news reports by clicking here or you can get the latest breaking news by clicking here or the most viral news on the channel the news at Hillary and Obama hate right here\n",

Thanks for waiting, and as a reward for your loyalty to my cause, here is a quick song I made for you. How long has the moon been in this rap game? Nowadays things just ain't the same, not enough kids down to kill the apes letting niggers in our schools. Such a shame, too many little wanes and drakes flooding the streets with purple drag. The moon is about to be fracked, killing niggers is my middle name, running over nigger bitches with a train. And a monster truck does mash their brains and they've only got their selves to blame. You should end up in black, too trigger a moon attack, should have remained slaves and checks. Now the KKKK coming from front and back, with body bags called niggers sex. Niggers aren't human check the facts, building walls from dead niggers stacks, tying monkey babies down in the middle of race tracks. How long do we have to wait until America is free again? Since niggers we ain't the same, they as well just change our names who nigger'll and and accept our wicked friends, liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids, a part of the moonman regiment, how long do we gotta listen to feminist bitches get to the church of feminism? Every nigger or woman I just like till that numbers of v.s.s.s. fits over a billion. And how long until Mexicans return to hell? America is tired of them and you can tell Donald Trump for president so ring the bell. Nasty wet backs will dot or rot in a cell. How long until Aryan children can play outside without fear of spooks to make them dot. Nightmares about niggers make children cry so make the filthy fucking animals cry.

      "Transcribed text for hate_video_24.mp3:  Okay, I strongly recommend that you read this article in the VDermagazine. I have the link below. It basically talks about two things. One is of course the average IQ of blacks is 85 compared to whites which is about 100. It's actually 103. Now keep in mind that 85 versus 100. It's not like 15% less. IQ tests are based on algorithms which means that the number is much bigger than you realize. In other words, it's not that you're beating someone by 15 yards in 100 yards dash. You're beating someone by 60 yards in 100 yards dash if your IQ is 100 points and your opponent is 85. So 85 is vastly inferior. It's really borderline retarded compared to whites. And then the article goes on and talk about the fact that this is all genetic. You can't do anything about it. They try to put blacks in better educational environment, put blacks that are raised by white couples. It's the same situation. Blacks IQ will be lower and they will show all those traits normally associated with being of African descent. Also the personality, they talk about the personality traits of blacks. One is called conchangesness impulse control issue. Extroversion, feeling positive, feeling positive, feeling strongly and taking risks. Agreeableness, altruism and empathy which of course blacks lack. Blacks don't have any empathy or altruism. They see a victim on the side of the street. Somebody and you see the videos, somebody who's drunk, let's say, or somebody drops that of a heart attack, they're not going to help them. They're going to riffle through their pockets to grab their wallets or whatever other possession they have. And last but not least is neuro-tissism, neuro-tissism, feeling negative, feeling strongly and thus being mentally unstable. It's a trait of blacks that they seem to be obsessed with certain particular topics like for instance, white racism. Research has also shown that blacks have negative ethnocentrism more than any other group, especially more than whites. They have strong negative feelings toward every other race. Black racism is way more than any other group in the world. They are safe in our white neighborhood, but whites or anybody else for them is not safe in a black neighborhood. They will be assaulted. They will do a video on that one another time. It will be assaulted if you are of another group and you walk through their neighborhoods. We all know that. We all know that. Your liberals know that. So I recommend that you read this article. Let me add also that blacks also have what is known as the basic four-personality disorders, which are really linked to the idea that blacks elect children in adult bodies. Aranoyah aggression, dependency, and narcissism. Excuse me, Paranoia aggression, dependency, and narcissism. These are all traits of children by which blacks never seem to recover. This is particularly bad because this is the reason why, of course, you have crime. You have serial killers, mesh shooters, etc. Racially motivated crimes are all the result of this personal disorder. Really articles. And I agree with most of it in a sense that I would add more to it.\n",

Dawson says that students use the slang version of the N-word at Valley High School all the time. He says, N-I-G-G-E-R is a racial slur, but says that students use N-I-G-G-A as often as they say do or, hey man, and Dawson says as much as he does not like the word, he still used the slang version to feel more comfortable with black students. Why is this word used so frequently? So I just don't understand it. And I'm trying to understand it. I need help. Yes, I use N-Gah. I've used it. I admit it. I put the H on it to emphasize it's N-Gah. You know, N-Gah, N-Gah, N-Gah, N-Gah, N-Gah, N-Gah, please. You know, can you lend a N-Gah a pencil? What kind of example are you setting for your students if you use a word that you don't want them to use? Upon reflection, that's not good. Dawson was suspended for 10 days without pay from January 9th to January 23rd, and he has to go to diversity training. He says that he's learned from this experience and hopes that others think twice before using the N-Word. I will never say any form of N-Gah, you know, I'm carried of that. And what did he say specifically to you? He said sit down N-Gah. Riley Freeman is a third grade student at J-Edger Hoover Elementary School. He's a basketball player and avid reader, and one day hopes to spread his philosophy through rap music. He was in class when he had a verbal exchange with his teacher, Joe Petto. But Mr. Petto said it was Riley who used the N-Word first. He told him to take his seat, and here comes this barrage of insults. I mean, some of the words I've never even heard before, and I was just stunned, and I said, well, sit down. N-Gah. I just repeated the insult back to him because that's what I've been trained to do. He said I used the word before, but I didn't. I wouldn't use that word ever. That word hurts people. Mr. Petto claims the version of N-Gur ending in G-R is the racial slur, but that he was using a different version of the word ending in G-R. That means the same as buddy or best pal. He insists that he was using the friendly version of the N-Word to better relate to Riley. I used the word I admitted. I thought there was a difference between N-Gur and N-Gah. I thought I understood this whole thing, but I guess I don't. I need help. Whenever I hear the rappers, they say N-Gah. It's in all the music. Look, look, look. Rap songs that use the word N-Gah in a positive way. There's tons of them. Look, real N-Gah roll call. N-Gah's bleed. Chigamon N-Gah. N-Gah's for life. Real N-Gah's don't die. Shaman N-Gah. Suck the N-Gah. Ain't no N-Gah. I don't understand is that if it's so offensive to them, then why do they say it over and over again. So Riley said the N-Word before you did that morning. He says it every morning. He calls me N-Gah. He calls the other kids N-Gah. He calls himself N-Gah. All the time. N-Gah is N-Gah that. N-Gah please. It's N-Gah. N-Gah have you lost your mind? N-Gah check that hoe. N-Gah you bullshit. Break yourself N-Gah. He says it so much. I don't even notice it anymore. Last week in lunch Riley says to a classmate, can a N-Gah borrow a French fry? And my first thought wasn't, oh my god he said the word, the N-Word. It was now how is a N-Gah gonna borrow a fry? N-Gah is you gonna give it back? I'll tell you. My inside voice didn't talk like that before he...\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_341.mp3:  50 years ago we produced the moon landing hoax. The tree we blaze filled with science fiction. Fold us all with the impossible. Today the crowds we exploit are even greater. To life farther we must be able to sustain the features of greater distance and duration. Your minds are the resources we harvest with our machinations. We pretend to overcome radiation, isolation, gravity, and extreme environments as we've always done. That's the video game we created to bind the minds of humanity. We're producing another moon hoax, a plate by 2024. And this is how. We want to believe we have the ability to get larger heavier payloads of planets and beyond Earth's gravity. For this we simulate an entirely new rocket space-like system. SLS be the most wasteful rocket ever developed. And without CGI production. And more in Dyson. This game system makes you think we can fly deep space missions. We feed your lives in capsules for you to believe our game from wasteful launches to CGI fake space in the good old parachute trick. For that trick we built Orion. This is NASA's next generation human space fiction. In 20 fake data maps from lunar orbiters, our programmers create many moon hazards and resources. We currently produce an entirely new hoax to landing and operating on the moon. Funding our commercial partners with your money to make up science instruments and robotic props. You are paying your way for human fictions in 2024. Our task is to hoax quickly and to keep it going, to cash our production efforts with a further income, wins the week that we return to the moon in a manner that is wholly different than 50 years ago. With our simulator reusable lunar landers, we pretend to land anywhere on our CGI lunar surface map. To sustain this fiction, we give them a platform in orbit around the moon from which to transition. A canister shaped platform to fake deep space experiments and be a mental dead zone for non-thinking humans. We call this linear outpost gateway. The beauty of the gateway trick is that we say it moves between orbits, balancing it at will, between the Earth's and Moon's gravity. With a fiction that is ideal for producing even deeper space missions. In 2009, we learned that the moon contained millions of space believer minds. These minds can be extracted and purified like water, and separated into oxygen for breeding or hygiene for rocket fuel. There's no moon hoax, it's quite uniquely designed to deceive us and propel us to Mars and beyond. I should you not believe it. This is where we're tricking more. This is a replicate throughout the solar fiction. This is the next genre for human space exploration. Humans are the most valuable subjects in this entire production, and yet we lie for humanity. We go to the moon and on to Mars to fake knowledge and understand and to spread lies everywhere. We lie knowing our stories will further new fictions that cannot be foreseen. We lie because we're destined to exploit you and deceive you, controlling all minds. We want another moon hoax now, a better illusion to serve as reinforcement. As a checkpoint for all the lies we told, our fake is adventures. Still ahead of us. We are fake in it. We're hoaxing. We are holding it. We are hoaxing. We're hoaxing.\n",

      "Transcribed text for non_hate_video_355.mp3:  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend our gratitude to the musicians and the dance company for your wonderful performance. This has been a wonderful evening, and not only for the music and the dancing, it has also been about us, the people gathered here. English people in the very heart of England. There are no people I would rather be among. No place I would rather be and no time I would rather be alive. Because ever since the terrible events of October when there are money markets betrayed us all, I have known that the change is coming. The human species has never faced such immense possibilities, such choices. In the lives of great nations, there are moments of destiny which have swept aside small men of convention and discovered men of the moment. And our host is such a man. For him, for him, the little calculations of little men mean nothing. Here's a man will suited to the mighty mood that England is now in. The only reason I say this now at this moment on this stage is because I have some news. Good news I've been. I'm sure our host will forgive me if I use this platform, this gathering of friends and like minds, to give you his trusted allies an early announcement of a long overdue event. I want to tell you good folk first that with a dawn of a new decade I will be setting a new course, setting up a new political movement here in the very heart of England. And Mr Shelby will be with me, shoulder to shoulder. It will offer a new conception of politics in which the great character of the British, our true character, will be reborn. Many of you lost four tunes in the recent stock market crash. The men of money, the capitalists in New York, the Jews, the money power, they run an international system in which the infinite mobility of money, its capacity to create financial chaos and panic, can bring down any government that dares for one moment to oppose it. For generations, the efforts of hardworking men like you have equipped our competitors against us, the cotton mills of India, the cotton mills of Asia, created with British money but used for the destruction of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The leaders of New York, the sweat and labor of the audience, combining to destroy the iron and steel factories of Warwickshire and Steffordshire. These are policies that could not be pursued by British statesmen unless they were met or the servants of Jewish finance. The things are the ones who took your money, what it is I and those who know this truth, who will like to flame the easiest cannot extinguish. The likes of our heroes of the Great War have been portrayed again and again by politicians. But here this, those of you who fought the Jew War for nothing, you brave men, you will join hands with the angry youth of Birmingham and Manchester and London and Liverpool and declare the England list tonight as matches on. I say this to you now because I believe it is in places like this with people like you that we will have to pass on our message directly. Our message can be summarised with these words. Britain first. And because this is our message, I doubt it will be reported fairly in the press. I'm afraid the newspapers of this country are owned by the same vested interests who took your money. They sell to the people false news to raise the interests of the faction and a section above the interests of the nation. So here my words and pass them on to those with ears to hear and be reminded that when the new decade begins there will be the birth of a new political party which will speak for you. This party, this new movement, this revolution will be called the British Union of Fascists.\n",

Look at those lions, some of them look like they're starving to death. Let's feed them to the fucking beasts. The sugar journey, say, call was in possession of a stolen person. See the mother fuckers, they're good at the fucking firearms. If there's anything that niggers are good at other than bullshit is owning fucking guns, man. You get into a conversation with them about fucking guns. They'll give you the whole rap, man. They know more about guns than fucking people in the military. So does nigger refuse to surrender to the police before he was shot by a man? So let me say something. I'll tell you exactly what happened. This guy, this is not a black cop who I'm sure realizes who he's dealing with because he's dealing with one of his own. He knows when niggers are all about. He knows, but I bet he just saw the motherfucker just shot him. And then they just put a gun in his pocket and get the fuck out of here with the motherfucker's man. Let's tell him for what it is, the fucking news media never tells the goddamn truth. So okay, so they had a demonstration. Oh, this was a peaceful demonstration. This was a peaceful demonstration in where was it? War, War, Tosa, where the fuck is that man? And why did I have engine names, fucking engine, man, motherfucker, and engine than the most serious people on the planet. We should change this Indian names to why people's name. Why does somebody fucking Indian names over here? What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that on that? And what do you mean? We have a state that's called New Mexico. Get the fuck out of here. We don't want to call it new United States. Get the fuck out of here with those foreign names. Anyway, Europe is appreciated.\n",

God damn more. Now I'm stuck watching Larry King. I'm stuck watching Filthy-ass Jewish Larry King make a filthy Jew of himself. I'm so sick of these fucking greedy bastards. Let me tell you Larry King has millions and millions of dollars. He was probably making 15 million a year his last 15 years on CNN. He's in his 80s. He set for life. There's no reason why he needs to do something underhanded for money. So he spends all this time on CNN building journalistic credibility with the elderly. Now what he's doing is infomercials. He's making these infomercials look like legitimate news interviews. He brings on someone and the person starts talking about his company and all the specials that they're having. It's made to fool old people into thinking that this is news and that this is a company that's somehow been verified by CNN or legitimate news. And it's just bullshit infomercial that's paid Larry King's Jewish ass to sit there and sell his fucking soul to make a few extra shillings that will never fucking spend. This is why motherfuckers bitch about the Jews because their greed is unquenchable. Their greed is beyond their life. Their greed is beyond life. It's beyond humanity. It's unfuckin' real. They're greed. I need to calm the fuck down and smoke a bowl and take one of those funny pills that my doctor gave me that makes me not want to hurt people supposedly. Please subscribe to my channel.

I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call a ratio profile, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea. The one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people because that in my estimation is the only conclusion I have come to. We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem. Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us and I will leave on that. So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem and the problem on the planet is white people.\n",
